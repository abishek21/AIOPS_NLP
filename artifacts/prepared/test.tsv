39424767	0	android studio emulator: WARNING: Increasing RAM size to 1024MB <p>I am trying to build my first android application in Android Studio, following the tutorial <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html</a>, using AndroidStudio 2.1.2. </p> <p>Whenever I run the emulator, I get this error message:</p> <blockquote> <p>Android Emulator could not allocate 1.0 GB of memory for the current AVD configuration. Consider adjusting the RAM size of your AVD in the AVD Manager. Error detail: QEMU 'pc.ram': Cannot allocate memory</p> </blockquote> <p>Decreasing the size of the memory on the Nexus5x emulator has no effect, so the error message still says "could not allocate 1.0 GB", even when I adjust the memory of the AVD to 256MB. The app needs to run on Android 6.0, with a Nexus5x emulator, so I can't try with a different emulator. Any help would be much appreciated :)</p>
8978532	0	NSView subclass over another NSView subclass? <p>I'm trying to create an Cocoa-AppleScript Application with some basic functions, and I want to display a background image for the window and then display a color box above it. </p> <p>I finally figured out how to set the background image via this guide (<a href="http://www.mere-mortal-software.com/blog/details.php?d=2007-01-08" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.mere-mortal-software.com/blog/details.php?d=2007-01-08</a>), but I don't know how to set a color box above it. The basic layout I'm trying to achieve is this:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o25EI.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>The window view has a class of <code>ViewBackground</code> which is a subclass of <code>NSView</code>. The <code>ViewBackground.m</code> file looks like this:</p> <pre><code>-(void)drawRect:(NSRect)rect { NSImage *anImage = [NSImage imageNamed:@"repeat"]; [[NSColor colorWithPatternImage:anImage] set]; NSRectFill([self bounds]); } </code></pre> <p>Like I said, that works fine. The problem is when I try to put the box with the background color white above it. I thought I would be able to do this by making a new subclass of <code>NSView</code>, <code>ContentBackground</code>. The <code>ContentBackground.m</code> file looks like this:</p> <pre><code>-(void)drawRect:(NSRect)rect { [[NSColor whiteColor] set]; NSRectFill(rect); } </code></pre> <p>The hierarchy of my windows looks like this:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PzF0I.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Now this <em>sometimes</em> works, but usually produces this result in the debugger:</p> <pre><code>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadAppleScriptObjectiveCScripts]; return NSApplicationMain(argc, (const char **)argv); Thread 1: Stopped at breakpoint 1 } </code></pre> <p>What am I doing wrong and how can I fix this?</p> <p>Also, the content (buttons, etc..) will go on top of the <code>ContentBackground</code> box.</p>

Judging by this answer: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4576909/understanding-canvas-and-surface-concepts">Understanding Canvas and Surface concepts</a></p> <p>All views get passed the same canvas with underlying bitmap to draw on so that the memory is not tripled.

Don't mind the width and margin of the navBar, because it's actually within another container as well.</p> <p>P.S I searched Google and StackOverFlow and I could not find an answer that was helpful. There were many questions about placing two divs within a single div, but none for aligning multiple divs within a single div.</p> <p>Thanks for any help in advance!</p>

7592838	0	Correct way to get beans from applicationContext Spring <p>I have a factory that creates instances:</p> <pre><code>public class myFactory { public static getInstace() { switch(someInt) { case 1: return new MySpringBean(); case 2: return new MyOtherSpringBean(); } } } </code></pre> <p>I need to return a new instance of the beans that are "managed" by Spring bc they have Transactional business logic methods. I have read in many posts here that I should not use getBean method to get a singleton or a new instance from the applicationContext. But I cannot find the proper way to do it for my case. I have used @Resource and it seems to work but it doesn't support static fields. Thanx </p>
2340952	0	<tbody> glitch in PHP Simple HTML DOM parser <p>I'm using PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser to scrape some data of a webshop (also running XAMPP 1.7.2 with PHP5.3.0), and I'm running into problems with <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> tag. The structure of the table is, essentialy (details aren't really that important):</p> <pre><code>&lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;!--text here--&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;!--text here--&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre> <p>Now, I'm trying to get to the <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> section by using code:</p> <pre><code>$element = $html-&gt;find('tbody',0)-&gt;innertext; </code></pre> <p>It doesn't throw any errors, it just prints nothing out when I try to echo it. I've tested the code on other elements, <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, even something like <code>&lt;span class="price"&gt;</code> and they all work fine (ofcourse, removing ",0" fails the code). They all give their correct sections. Outertext ditto. But it all fails on <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>.</p> <p>Now, I've skimmed through the Parser, but I'm not sure I can figure it out. I've noticed that <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> isn't even mentioned, but it works fine. <em>shrug</em></p> <p>I guess I could try and do child navigation, but that seems to glitch as well. I've just tried running:</p> <pre><code>$el = $html-&gt;find('table',0); $el2 = $el-&gt;children(2); echo $el2-&gt;outertext; </code></pre> <p>and no dice. Tried replacing <code>children</code> with <code>first_child</code> and 2 with 1, and still no dice. Funny, though, if I try <code>-&gt;find</code> instead of <code>children</code>, it works perfectly.</p> <p>I'm pretty confident I could find a work-around the whole thing, but this behaviour seems odd enough to post here. My curious mind is happy for all the help it can get.</p>

Now I'm not sure how to call <code>make</code>. I can't call it from <code>glibc</code> directory since it doesn't have the configuration set, neither I can call it from <code>build-glibc</code>, since makefile is not in that directory. How do I solve this problem?</p>

22064095	1	fast system calls in R <p>I have a nest for loop inside which I run a python script using the system call option in R, I found that all the execution time of my code is spent just on the system call in order to run the python script, so I was wondering if there is any tricks that I can use to save this great loss of time spent on repeatedly using the system call especially cause the python script in itself only take 1 second per each call, the problem is that I can't run the .py script independently cause I's using some parameters generated by other parts in R. here is a snapshot of my code and any suggestion is highly appreciated:</p> <pre><code> for(x in 1:10000){ ....... for (y in 1:10000){ ..... x=system("python calc.py -c1 -c2",intern = TRUE) } } </code></pre>

10277401	0	Generating all possible permutations for a given base and number of digits <p>I'm sure this is pretty simple, but I'm stumped for a way to do this. Essentially if I have an array with P collumns and V^P rows, how can I fill in all the combinations, that is, essentially, all possible numbers in base V of P digits. For example, for P=3 and V=2:</p> <pre><code>000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 </code></pre> <p>Keep in mind that this is an 2 dimensional array, not an array of ints.</p> <p>For P=4 and V=3.</p> <pre><code>0000 0001 0002 0010 0011 0012 .... </code></pre> <p>Having this array generated, the rest of work for what I'm trying to devolop is trivial.

38432624	0	Fast inserting or updating data from huge JSON to MYSQL with php <p>In a project of mine I have a problem updating my mysql db from a huge json. the json object in question consist of ~1000 entries like this:</p> <pre><code>[{ "uniqueId":"578742901714e", "lat": -76.760541, "lng": 121.289062, "description":"foo and bar", "visible": true }] </code></pre> <p>In order to compare the data in the json to the database, I used different statements enclosed in different loops. While this worked it took some time ~45 seconds for the whole json to be processed and written.</p> <p><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong></p> <p><strong>To clarify, I loop through the array returned by json_decode() and compare the data directly to the Database via SELECT and INSERT STATEMENTS - which works but is slow as hell, because the data is huge</strong></p> <p>Because the user has to wait for this to ensure data integrity, I decided this should be sped up.</p> <p>So I looked using INSERT INTO ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE, which should work with multiple data sets.</p> <p>But here's the real problem: Because some entries like "description" are saved in their own table I need something like LAST_INSERT_ID() to know the auto-increment id of the just inserted dataset. But LAST_INSERT_ID() doesn't work that way and only returns the first row if it is used in a batch INSERT. (<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/information-functions.html#function_last-insert-id" rel="nofollow">Documentation</a>)</p> <p>So I'm stuck between a functioning but very slow execution and a non-functioning but (supposedly) very fast execution.</p> <p>I don't really know how to proceed, can you help me?</p> <hr> <p><strong>Edit:</strong></p> <p>The database in question consists of some tables. The most prominent ones are the following two:</p> <p>table poi:</p> <pre><code>#1 id int auto-increment primary #2 unique_id varchar(13) unique #3 date int(11) #4 visible tinyint(1)/bool </code></pre> <p>table poi_description:</p> <pre><code>#1 id int auto-increment primary #2 poi_id int(11) #3 description text #4 date int(11) #5 user int(11) </code></pre> <p>I read so much in the last two days that I'm really not sure how to update the rows if the uniqueid is already in the table. I thought, I could get it to work with INSERT ON DUPLICATE UPDATE, but that looks only for the primary key - at least that's how it looks to me.</p>

37129365	0	Contenteditable, bizarre behaviour of child elements, and NOT whitespace independent? <p>I've been playing around with <code>contenteditable</code> fields, and have come across an odd behaviour that I cannot figure out.</p> <p>Check out <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/13u00nus/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">fiddle</a> for this particular problem.</p> <p>I have two <em>identical</em> <code>contenteditable</code> divs. Both of them have the same <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> child, followed by a single blank character (otherwise carrot issues ensue).

You should also notice that that in the second div, no amount of backspacing will ever clear it out. At least not in Safari.</p> <p>So what gives!?

38444485	0	Use std::bind to remove arguments <p>I'm currently coding against a library that uses an event system to signify user interface interactions. Each listener can either be a pointer to an object and a function to call, or a std::function. For example, the MenuItem object defines an OnClick event that will call a function that takes a MenuItem*:</p> <pre><code>someMenuItem-&gt;OnClick.addListener( this, &amp;myObj.doSomeAction ); ... void myObj::doSomeAction( MenuItem* menuItem ) {} </code></pre> <p>or</p> <pre><code>someMenuItem-&gt;OnClick.addListener( []( MenuItem* menuItem ) {} ); </code></pre> <p>It's often the case that doSomeAction is part of the public API of the class that we might want to call for some reason other than the user selecting the menu item. Is it possible to use std::bind to throw away the MenuItem* argument so that <code>doSomeAction( MenuItem* menuItem )</code> could be defined as simply <code>doSomeAction()</code>?</p> <p>PS - I do realize that I could use lambdas to do the same thing, but if bind can do the same thing then it might be more stylistically pleasing to some.</p>

I had already implemented a client in Java but now I need to implement a client-side application to access CXF. I'm not even sure that it's possible to do that (Accessing CXF directly from client-side). If it's possible then kindly direct me to some ajax code. If not, then please help me with your ideas for a web-based CFX client. Thanks</p>

30643331	0	How can I wait for an application launched by another application launched by my application Qt/C++ <p>I'm creating a Windows Add/Remove Programs application in Qt 5.4 and I'm becaming crazy to solve a little "puzzle":</p> <p>My application (APP_0) runs another application (APP_1) and waits for this APP_1 until it terminates. </p> <p>APP_1 is an uninstaller (i.e. uninstall.exe) and I've not the source code of the APP_1, just of my Qt APP_0.</p> <p>APP_1, instead of doing the uninstall job, it simply copies itself somewhere in the filesystem (I saw as Au_.exe but other apps could use different names and locations), runs this copy of itself (APP_2) and terminates.</p> <p>The APP_2 has a GUI and the job I'm waiting for (uninstall) is demanded to the final user of the running APP_2.</p> <p>In this situation my application (APP_0) stops waiting for APP_1 pratically immediately (because it launches APP_1 and waits for APP_1). But to work properly, obviously, I need to know instead when APP_2 is terminated...</p> <p>So the question is: is there a way (using some techniques (hooking?)) to know if and when APP_2 terminates?</p> <p>Note: Consider that the standard Windows Add/Remove Programs utility does the job successfully (it seems it waits for APP_2). You can test this, for example, installing Adobe Digital Edition. Its uninstaller (uninstall.exe) copies itself into a new folder in the User_Local_Temp folder as Au_.exe, runs it and terminates. But the OS utility successfully waits for Au_.exe and only after it terminates refreshes the list of installed programs.</p> <p>If this kind of technique (uninstall.exe copies itself somewhere ALWAYS with THE SAME name (Au_.exe) ) the problem could be resolved, obviously, very simply. But I don't think that the name of the copied uninstaller is always the same and also I don't like to assume things I'm not sure are real.</p> <p>Many thanks in advance</p>

I'm using, among others, the delegate methods <code>tokenField(tokenField: NSTokenField, representedObjectForEditingString editingString: String) -&gt; AnyObject</code> and <code>tokenField(tokenField: NSTokenField, displayStringForRepresentedObject representedObject: AnyObject) -&gt; String?</code> to work with represented objects. My represented objects are instances of a custom class.</p> <p>From the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/TokenField_Guide/GetSetTokenFields/GetSetTokenFields.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006555-CH9-SW2" rel="nofollow">Apple Documentation</a>, I know that <code>objectValue</code> can be used to access the represented objects of a <code>NSTokenView</code> as a <code>NSArray</code>:</p> <blockquote> <p>To retrieve the objects represented by the tokens in a token field, send the token field an <code>objectValue</code> message. Although this method is declared by <code>NSControl</code>, <code>NSTokenField</code> implements it to return an array of represented objects. If the token field simply contains a series of strings, <code>objectValue</code> returns an array of strings. To set the represented objects of a token field, use the <code>setObjectValue</code>: method, passing in an array of represented objects. If these objects aren’t strings, <code>NSTokenField</code> then queries its delegate for the display strings to use for each token.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, this doesn't seem to work for me. <code>let tokenArray = self.tokenField.objectValue! as! NSArray</code> does return a NSArray, but it is empty, even though the delegate method required to return a represented object has been called the appropriate amount of times before.</p> <p><code>NSTokenView</code> doesn't seem like a particularly strong tool to work with tokenization, but, lacking an alternative, I hope that you guys can help me making my implementation work.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p>

25743133	0	Are stack float array ops faster than heap float ops on modern x86 systems? <p>On C float (or double) arrays small enough to fit in L1 or L2 cache (about 16k), and whos size I know at compile time, is there generally a speed benefit to define them within the function they are used in, so they are stack variables? If so is it a large difference? I know that in the old days heap variables were much slower than stack ones, but nowadays with the far more complicated structure of cpu addressing and cache, I don't know if this is true. </p> <p>I need to do repeated runs of floating point math over these arrays in 'chunks', over and over again over the same arrays (about 1000 times), and I wonder if I should define them locally. I imagine keeping them in the closest / fastest locations will allow me to iterate over them repeatedly much faster but I dont understand the implications of caching in this scenario. Perhaps the compiler or cpu is clever enough to realize what I am doing and make these data arrays highly local on the hardware during the inner processing loops without my intervention, and perhaps it does a better job than I can at this. </p> <p>Maybe I risk running out of stack space if I load large arrays in this way? Or is stack space not hugely limited on modern systems? The array size can be defined at compile time and I only need one array, and one CPU as I need to stick to a single thread for this work.</p>

I know that for recording audio I can use getUserMedia and for speech to text input I can use x-webkit-speech. I'm OK with the browser limitation. Is there a way that I can do this in a single step? </p> <p>I'd prefer an HTML5 solution, but I'm willing to go with javascript if that's the only way to do it. I'm also willing to consider server side solutions if necessary (LAMP environment). This would likely be only accessed on a laptop/desktop browser, but if I can also make it compatible with mobile devices, that would be great, too. </p>

Those sites work and some of them have opengraph action video.watches ("Watch"). It's approved and works.</p> <p>Recently I got a generic Facebook email that one or more of my apps are using permissions that have to be reviewed or they will stop working on some date. As those apps are quite old they don't have publish_actions in the review set (and that's the only extra permission in that video.watches websites). So now - does Facebook wants that publish_actions to be added to the review or it's something else (they could be more specific)?</p>

In my experience, this is not true. My problem though is that some 90% of the code I write has a TON of operating system calls. The time spent to actually mock these up takes <em>much</em> longer than just writing the code in the first place. Sometimes 4 or 5 times as long to write the test as to write the actual code.</p> <p>I'm curious if there are other developers in this kind of a scenario.</p>

28711174	0	Showing message after customer is redirected to logout page magento <p>I have a problem here. I want to show a message to the customer after his/her session is out. Let me explain in detail. I have a case, at first the customer is logged in when the customer clicks the "My Account" he/she is redirected to customer login page.Here i want to show the message that "your session is out please log in again".</p> <p>One method i tried is to check the customer session in indexAction() in AcountController.php but this redirection is not taking place from this indexAction().</p> <p>I am guessing that this redirection is taking somewhere from the block because "My Account" link is added through the xml file using "addLink" method.But i couldn't figure it out.</p> <p>Has anyone faced such problem and has solved it. Can anyone provide me with some insights so i can fix it.</p>
40587641	0	How can I start/stop a stop watch with only the spacebar? <p>I want to start/stop a stop watch only using the spacebar. I already made the KeyListeners, and that they only get activated when you press/release the spacebar.</p> <p>What I tried so far:</p> <p>I tried creating a stopwatch class, which SHOULD calculate the time difference between me pressing space for the first time, and second time. I tried it as follows:</p> <pre><code> public class Stopwatch { public Stopwatch(int i) { long time = System.currentTimeMillis(); if(i%2==1){ System.out.println("Timer Started at: " + time); }else{ System.out.println("Timer stopped at: " + System.currentTimeMillis()); System.out.println("Time diff: " + (time - System.currentTimeMillis())); } }} </code></pre> <p><code>int i</code> increases with every second spacebar press.</p> <p>I know the problem here is that everytime I start this class, <code>time</code> is getting reset to System.currentTimeMillis() because I only press Spacebar. Thus the difference is always 0.</p> <p>How can I change this so that I can somehow save the time I first pressed space?</p> <p>Here is the class with the Keylisteners. Ignore the Scrambler class, it has nothing to do with my Problem.</p> <pre><code> import java.awt.Font; import java.awt.event.ActionEvent; import java.awt.event.ActionListener; import java.awt.event.KeyEvent; import java.awt.event.KeyListener; import javax.swing.*; public class StoppuhrFrame extends JFrame { JLabel time, scramble; public StoppuhrFrame() { time = new JLabel("00:00:00"); time.setBounds(162, 45, 325, 80); time.setFont(new Font("Arial", 100, 80)); add(time); scramble = new JLabel("Scramble: "); scramble.setBounds(165, 15, 370, 16); add(scramble); //Scrambler scrambler = new Scrambler(scramble); addKeyListener(new timer()); setTitle("Cube Timer"); setLayout(null); setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); setResizable(false); setSize(650, 270); setVisible(true); } int i = 1; public class timer implements KeyListener { @Override public void keyPressed(KeyEvent keyEvent) { if(keyEvent.getKeyCode()==32){ new Stopwatch(i); i++; } @Override public void keyReleased(KeyEvent arg0) { if (arg0.getKeyCode() == 32) { if(i%2==0){ //new Scrambler(scramble); } } } @Override public void keyTyped(KeyEvent arg0) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub } }} </code></pre> <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
2935604	0	Qt cross thread call <p>I have a Qt/C++ application, with the usual GUI thread, and a network thread. The network thread is using an external library, which has its own select() based event loop... so the network thread isn't using Qt's event system.</p> <p>At the moment, the network thread just emit()s signals when various events occur, such as a successful connection. I think this works okay, as the signals/slots mechanism posts the signals correctly for the GUI thread.</p> <p>Now, I need for the network thread to be able to call the GUI thread to ask questions. For example, the network thread may require the GUI thread to request put up a dialog, to request a password.</p> <p>Does anyone know a suitable mechanism for doing this?</p> <p>My current best idea is to have the network thread wait using a QWaitCondition, after emitting an object (<code>emit passwordRequestedEvent(passwordRequest);</code>. The passwordRequest object would have a handle on the particular QWaitCondition, and so can signal it when a decision has been made..</p> <p>Is this sort of thing sensible? or is there another option?</p>

9816460	0	Loop Design: Counting & Subsequent Code Duplication <p>Exercise 3-3 in Accelerated C++ has led me to two broader questions about loop design. The exercise's challenge is to read an arbitrary number of words into a vector, then output the number of times a given word appears in that input. I've included my relevant code below:</p> <pre><code>string currentWord = words[0]; words_sz currentWordCount = 1; // invariant: we have counted i of the current words in the vector for (words_sz i = 1; i &lt; size; ++i) { if (currentWord != words[i]) { cout &lt;&lt; currentWord &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; currentWordCount &lt;&lt; endl; currentWord = words[i]; currentWordCount = 0; } ++currentWordCount; } cout &lt;&lt; currentWord &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; currentWordCount &lt;&lt; endl; </code></pre> <p>Note that the output code has to occur again outside the loop to deal with the last word. I realize I could move it to a function and simply call <em>the function</em> twice if I was worried about the complexity of duplicated code.</p> <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is this sort of workaround is common? Is there a typical way to refactor the loop to avoid such duplication?</p> <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> While my solution is straightforward, I'm used to counting from zero. Is there a more-acceptable way to write the loop respecting that? Or is this the optimal implementation?</p>

The first one a login column which was set to int with auto increment and 25 characters. The second one is a password one which was set to var_char and 25 characters. </p> <p>I filled in all of the information on the setup scripts from the website I linked to earlier completely correctly but every single time I try to register I get this error code: </p> <blockquote> <p>Database Login failed!

Also if there is no caption, then the BR tag should be omitted.</p> <hr> <h2>Considered Technique Nº1</h2> <p>Given that i don't want to have to build entire HTML fragments in C# code, i <em>considered</em> something like:</p> <pre><code>%ANCHORSTARTTAGPREFIX%&lt;A href="%PANELLINK%" target="_blank"&gt;%ANCHORSTARTTAGPOSTFIX% &lt;IMG border="0" src="%PANELIMAGE%" style="%IMAGESTYLE%"&gt; %ANCHORENDTAGPREFIX%&lt;/A&gt;%ANCHORENDTAGPOSTFIX%CAPTIONPREFIX%&lt;BR&gt; %CAPTIONTEXT%%CAPTIONPOSTFIX% </code></pre> <p>with the idea that i could use the pre and postfixes to turn the HTML code into:</p> <pre><code>&lt;!--&lt;A href="%PANELLINK%" target="_blank"&gt;--&gt; &lt;IMG border="0" src="%PANELIMAGE%" style="%IMAGESTYLE%"&gt; &lt;!--&lt;/A&gt;--&gt;&lt;!--&lt;BR&gt; %CAPTIONTEXT%--&gt; </code></pre> <p>But that is just rediculous, plus one answerer reminds us that it wastes bandwith, and can be buggy.</p> <hr> <h2>Considered Technique Nº2</h2> <p>Wholesale replacement of tags:</p> <pre><code>%AnchorStartTag% &lt;IMG border="0" src="%PANELIMAGE%" style="%IMAGESTYLE%"&gt; %AnchorEndTag%%CaptionStuff% </code></pre> <p>and doing a find-replace to change</p> <pre><code>%AnchorStartTag% </code></pre> <p>with</p> <pre><code>"&lt;A href=\"foo\" target=\"blank\"" </code></pre> <hr> <h2>Considered Technique Nº3</h2> <p>i considered giving an ID to the important HTML elements:</p> <pre><code>&lt;A id="anchor" href="%PANELLINK%" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;IMG border="0" src="%PANELIMAGE%" style="%IMAGESTYLE%"&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR id="captionBreak"&gt; %CAPTIONTEXT% </code></pre> <p>and then using an HTML DOM parser to programatically delete nodes.

20895184	0	Identical template for many functions <h1>Hello guys (and happy new year!)</h1> <p>I'm writing a (not really) simple project in C++ (my first, coming from plain C). I was wondering if there is a way to simplify the definition for multiple functions having the same template pattern. I think an example would be better to explain the problem.</p> <h2>The context</h2> <p>Let's assume I have a "Set" class which represents a list of numbers, defined as</p> <pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt; class Set { static_assert(std::is_arithmetic&lt;T&gt;(), "Template argument must be an arithmetic type."); T *_address; ... } </code></pre> <p>So if I have an instance (say <code>Set&lt;double&gt;</code>) and an array <code>U array[N]</code>, where <code>U</code> is another arithmetic type and <code>N</code> is an integer, I would like to be able to perform some operations such as assigning the values of the array to those of the <code>Set</code>. Thus I create the function template inside the class</p> <pre><code>template &lt;class U, int N&gt; void assign(U (&amp;s)[N]) { static_assert(std::is_arithmetic&lt;U&gt;(), "Template argument must be an arithmetic type."); errlog(E_BAD_ARRAY_SIZE, N == _size); idx_t i = 0; do { _address[i] = value[i]; } while (++i &lt; size); } </code></pre> <h2>The problem</h2> <p>As far as my tests went the code above works perfectly fine. However I find it REALLY REALLY ugly to see since I need the <code>static_assert</code> to ensure that only arithmetic types are taken as arguments (parameter <code>U</code>) and I need a way to be sure about the array size (parameter <code>N</code>). Also, I'm not done with the <code>assign</code> function but I need so many other functions such as <code>add</code>, <code>multiply</code>, <code>scalar_product</code> etc. etc.!</p> <h2>The first solution</h2> <p>I was wondering then if there is a prettier way to write this kind of class. After some work I've come up with a preprocessor directive:</p> <pre><code>#define arithmetic_v(_U_, _N_, _DECL_, ...) \ template &lt;class U, idx_t N&gt; _DECL_ \ { \ static_assert(std::is_arithmetic&lt;U&gt;(),"Rvalue is not an arithmetic type."); \ errlog(E_BAD_ARRAY_SIZE, N == _size); \ __VA_ARGS__ \ } </code></pre> <p>thus defining my function as</p> <pre><code>arithmetic_v(U, N, void assign(U (&amp;value)[N]), idx_t i = 0; do { _address[i] = value[i]; } while (++i &lt; _size); ) </code></pre> <p>This is somehow cleaner but still isn't the best since I'm forced to lose the brackets wrapping the function's body (having to include the <code>static_assert</code> INSIDE the function itself for the template parameter <code>U</code> to be in scope).</p> <h2>The question</h2> <p>The solution I've found seems to work pretty well and the code is much more readable than before, but... Can't I use another construct allowing me to build an even cleaner definition of all the functions and still preserving the <code>static_assert</code> piece and the info about the array size? It would be really ugly to repeat the template code once for each function I need...</p> <h2>The thanks</h2> <p>I'm just trying to learn about the language, thus ANY additional information about this argument will be really appreciated. I've searched as much as I could stand but couldn't find anything (maybe I just couldn't think of the appropriate keywords to ask Google in order to find something relevant). Thanks in advance for your help, and <strong>happy new year to you all</strong>!</p> <p>Gianluca</p>

13031158	0	Unwanted left margin when using -webkit-transform: scale(...) <p>I am using wkhtmltopdf (which uses the Webkit rendering engine) to convert HTML files to PDF documents. The generated PDFs are A4. In other words, they have fixed dimensions, and thus a limited width.</p> <p>One of the tables in my PDF contains images, which are intricately pieced together in a puzzle-like fashion, and which sometimes take up a lot of room.</p> <p>To fit the resulting puzzle in the constraints of an A4 PDF, I am applying the CSS property -webkit-transform: scale(...);</p> <p>This scales the puzzle beautifully, and it is still clearly legible, but for some reason it also pushes the table containing the puzzle to the right. It seems to be adding a significant margin to the left of the puzzle table, despite my explicitly setting its left margin to 0.</p> <p>Interestingly enough, the smaller the scale in my webkit transformation, the bigger the margin on the left. So for example, if I use scale(0.75) the resulting left margin is around 200 pixels. If I use scale(0.5) the resulting left margin is around 400 pixels.</p> <p>I've tried aligning the puzzle table to the left using absolute, fixed and relative positioning with left: 0. I've also tried floating it to the left, as well as sticking it in a container with text-align set to left. None of these techniques work.</p> <p>Any ideas where this left margin is coming from and how I can remove it / work around it?</p>

Is there php code or a drupal setting of some sort that can create a link relative to the local machine setup?</p> <p>To give more context: My friend and I are working on creating a drupal site and have individually setup our local files differently (we are sharing the database which is on a remote server). When browsing to the site, his URL shows up: <code>localhost/content/page</code>. Whereas how I have it setup is: <code>localhost/sitename/content/page</code>.</p> <p>When I create an internal link in the nav menu, I have to create it using a relative path /content/page, otherwise the link wont work on my coworkers localhost. This, in turn, makes it so that the link doesn't work on my locahost.</p> <p>Is there a way I can create these links relative to the localhost so that it works on both machines? When creating a navigation menu using my Drupal theme this is not an issue, but since the link list I'm creating is custom coded, I can't seem to figure out how to mimic this same functionality.</p> <p>Any ideas?

I'm obviously thinking about escaping this HTML and it seems to work but I would prefer consumers not to bother escaping a potentially large template. I know ASP.NET is capable of handling this but I wonder if it can be done with ServiceStack.</p> <p>The following JSON body is received incomplete at the REST endpoint because of the second double quote ...="test...</p> <pre><code>{ "template" : "&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div name="test"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;" } </code></pre>

It was requested that I squash the two commits into a single commit. This is what I have done:</p> <pre><code>git status On branch macaroni git log commit def feedback fixes commit abc fix cheddar flavor git rebase -i origin/master .. go through screen where I pick commit to squash .. .. go through screen where I update commit message .. git log commit abc fix cheddar flavor, squashing done! </code></pre> <p>at this point I believe I have to push my topic branch using the -force flag, because I have changed history:</p> <pre><code>git push -f </code></pre> <p>I am using the second answer from this question:</p> <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7947322/preferred-github-workflow-for-updating-a-pull-request-after-code-review">Preferred Github workflow for updating a pull request after code review</a></p> <p>with subtitle "Optional - Cleaning commit history". The author mentions at the end that you should be using topic branches, not sure if I should have changed any of the commands since I'm already on a topic branch.</p> <p>I am also concerned with accidentally force-pushing something onto the master branch with the above since I'm using -f, but since I'm on the topic branch, only that branch should be affected, right?</p> <p>Thanks</p>
37154863	1	How to multiplex python coroutines( send and receive) in a websocket based chat client via an event loop <p>I am writing a console based chat server based on websockets and asyncio for learning both websockets and asyncio without using any other frameworks like Twisted, Tornado etc .. So far I have established the connection between client and server and am able to unicast and multicast messages between logged in users by writing send and receive in a single coroutine but this makes the clients block on either send or receive. So I tried by splitting up the send and receive coroutines but now after sending the first message to the server the client is unable to send any other message. </p> <p>Problems: </p> <ol> <li>I have two coroutines for receive and send respectively but I am not able to multiplex them to execute concurrently via the event loop. I managed to asynchronize the input from the stdin based on another article on stack overflow but I am still not able to run them concurrently so that send and receive can happen simultaneously.</li> <li>I am not sure if trying to make a connection with the websocket in both the coroutines is the correct way or not.</li> </ol> <p>Below is the code sample for the minimal client that i am using. What I have understood from asyncio till now is that when one of the coroutine is waiting over its "yield from", the other coroutine will get a chance to execute please point out if my understanding of the asyncio is correct or not:</p> <pre><code>import sys import asyncio import websockets qSend = asyncio.Queue() def got_stdin_data(qSend): asyncio.async(qSend.put(sys.stdin.readline())) def myClient_recv(): websocket = yield from websockets.connect('ws://localhost:8765/') while True: recvText = yield from websocket.recv() print("&gt;&gt;&gt; {}".format(recvText)) def myClient_send(): websocket = yield from websockets.connect('ws://localhost:8765/') while True: sendText = yield from qSend.get() yield from websocket.send(sendText) loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() loop.add_reader(sys.stdin, got_stdin_data, qSend) asyncio.async(myClient_recv()) asyncio.async(myClient_send()) loop.run_forever() </code></pre>

There are ways to work around these flaws, like throwing errors from methods which should be abstract, but these work arounds are annoying and not very elegant. (Throwing an error from a method that should be abstract is a run-time check, not compile-time, which can lead to a lot of frustration).</p> <p>I know actionscript 3.0 follows the current ECMAscript standard and this is the reason for its lack of private constructors, but what about abstract classes, are they not in the ECMAscript standard eather?</p> <p>I guess the more specific question is why does ECMAscript standard not support private constructors?

32227126	0	CentOs Magento files created as directories? <p>I noticed a few days ago that a few files that belong to a certain Magento extension were in fact created as directories and not in fact the .png .css and .js files that they were supposed to be. When updating the extension there are errors as the files are unable to overwrite the existing directories. I mainly noticed this due to the icons being missing from the Magento admin panel. Although baffling, no big deal, I deleted the directories (x4) and copied the correct files from the original distribution. Problem solved.</p> <p>I used find . -type d "<em>.</em>" and also the 'empty' option to identify directories which should be files. This fixes the symptom but not the cause. There were around 10 files, mostly images but some .js and .css affected.</p> <p>I've just run an update of M2e via Magento connect, 'successfully', but having noticed some missing icons/graphics in admin I checked the code and have identified 17 empty directories that should have been image files (.png and .gif).</p> <p>I guess my questions are how and why is this happening? How can I stop it happening again?</p> <p>I have a dedicated CentOS server running Apache. Installs are done via Filezilla FTP upload or Magento Connect, it seems most likely that it's Connect causing the problem, both extensions have been updated by Connect at least once in their lifetime.</p> <p>Hoping someone can enlighten me, though not a huge problem in itself, it is a concern that critical files (rather than images) may be prone to the same problems...Anyone seen this before??</p> <p>Cheers RobH</p>

6208732	0	LINQ to JSON in .net 4.0 Client Profile <p>How would I go about about using LINQ to JSON in the .net 4 Client Profile in C#. I'd like to query certain json responses as shown in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mikeormond/archive/2008/08/21/linq-to-json.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="msdn blog">msdn blog post</a> without having to write out a contract (datacontract, servicecontract, etc). I really only need to query(read) the response, I don't need to modify the json response. (Also would a datacontract be faster than LINQ to JSON?)</p> <p>Alternatively I could use XML or the full .net 4 framework, but I'm hoping that this can be avoided. I can use external libraries if it's better than installing the whole framework.</p>

But it seems as the first if statement in the is messing things up. If I comment the if statement, everything works like a charm (except to check the default radio button if old input is missing).</p> <p>The line <code>{{ old('type_of_content') }}</code> is from the Laravel Framework to retrieve old form input data if the validation fails.</p> <pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){ // Set the checked radiobutton var radio_checked = '{{ old('type_of_content') }}'; if (radio_checked) { // check if variable is empty or not $('input:radio[id='+radio_checked+']').attr('checked', true); }else{ $('input:radio[id=is_question]').attr('checked', true); } $.fn.showQuestion = function(){ $("#remove_questions_choices").show(); $("#remove_questions_box").show(); $("#data").show(); // Fråga $("#information_body").hide(); $("#is_information").attr("checked", false) $("#is_question").attr("checked", true) alert('Question is selected') } $.fn.showInformation = function(){ $("#remove_questions_choices").hide(); $("#remove_questions_box").hide(); $("#data").hide(); $("#information_body").show(); $("#is_question").attr("checked", false) $("#is_information").attr("checked", true) alert('Information is selected') } // If radio button is changed by user click $('input:radio[name=type_of_content]').change(function () { if ($("#is_question:checked").val()) { $.fn.showQuestion(); } if ($("#is_information:checked").val()) { $.fn.showInformation(); } }); // When a radio button is selected on page load (working) $('#is_question:checked').val(function(){ $.fn.showQuestion(); }); $('#is_information:checked').val(function(){ $.fn.showInformation(); }); }); </code></pre> <p>The expected result should be to check if old input data exist, and check the corresponding radio button if so. Else, check the "default" radio button.

Both of which I have no control over and have the same namespace within them.</p> <p>So...</p> <p>I have <code>foo.dll</code> that contains a <code>Widget</code> class that is located on the <code>Blue.Red.Orange</code> namespace.</p> <p>I have <code>bar.dll</code> that also contains a <code>Widget</code> class that is also located on the <code>Blue.Red.Orange</code> namespace.</p> <p>Finally I have my application that needs to reference both <code>foo.dll</code> and <code>bar.dll</code>. This is needed as within my application I need to use the <code>Widget</code> class from <code>foo</code> and also the <code>Widget</code> class from <code>bar</code></p> <p>So, the question is how can I manage these references so that I can be certain I am using the correct <code>Widget</code> class?</p> <p>As mentioned, I have no control over the <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code> libraries, they are what they are and cannot be changed.

21123593	0	How to get the value of a static object from within that object? <p>I’m trying to create a extern pointer to the value of a static object from within that static object. We’ll call this object Foo.</p> <p>Thus far, the only way I’ve gotten this to work is to create a Supervisor class that Foo inherits from that contains two static type variables. One, called superObject is the actual initialized object. The other, called superPointer, is a double pointer of the same type. Inside of the Foo object I declare an extern pointer named TheSupervisor and assign it a nullptr. Then, from within the Supervisor base class, I use the double pointer superPointer to change the value of TheSupervisor extern pointer to the address of the superObject. Wallah.</p> <p>The goal is here to create a globally accessible reference to this object. Trying my best to avoid singletons and keep things thread safe. I’m just wondering if there’s a better way?</p> <p>I'd post code, but I'd really have to clean it and change it around. I think the description is sufficient. Maybe even simpler, actually.</p> <p>EDIT: As it turns out, for static objects, I can't rely on when and in what order they are constructed. Using a one-phase process won't work for this. Instead, I have to keep relying on a two-phase process such as the one I outlined above. Marking Ilya Kobelevskiy's answer as correct as it demonstrates one way to do it, but again, it should come with a warning when used with static objects.</p>
10629435	0	Backbone.js rendering a reset collection with a single view <p>I'm trying to render a filtered collection from a single view using a select box using the reset property. First issue is that the select box and the rendered content must all appear in the same div in order to work. Is this normal? Second issue, is that instead showing the filtered results only, it appends the filtered collection to the end of the rendered content instead of replacing it.I know append in my ._each function won't work because it will only append the filtered items to the end of the entire collection. Here's my code sample below:</p> <pre><code>(function($) { var images = [ { tags: "Fun", date : "April 3, 2012", location : 'Home', caption : 'Having fun with my lady'}, { tags: "Chillin", date : "April 4, 2012", location : 'Home', caption : 'At the park with my lady'}, { tags: "Professional", date : "April 5, 2012", location : 'Home', caption : 'At the crib with my lady'}, { tags: "Education", date : "April 6, 2012", location : 'Home', caption : 'Having fun with my baby'}, { tags: "Home", date : "April 3, 2012", location : 'Home', caption : 'Having fun with my lady'}, { tags: "Professional", date : "April 4, 2012", location : 'Home', caption : 'At the park with my lady'}, { tags: "Fun", date : "April 5, 2012", location : 'Home', caption : 'At the crib with my lady'}, { tags: "Chillin", date : "April 6, 2012", location : 'Home', caption : 'Having fun with my baby'}, { tags: "Fun", date : "April 3, 2012", location : 'Home', caption : 'Having fun with my lady'}, { tags: "Education", date : "April 4, 2012", location : 'Home', caption : 'At the park with my lady'}, { tags: "Personal", date : "April 5, 2012", location : 'Home', caption : 'At the crib with my lady'}, { tags: "Personal", date : "April 6, 2012", location : 'Home', caption : 'Having a play date'} ]; var Item = Backbone.Model.extend({ defaults : { photo : 'http://placehold.it/200x250' } }); var Album = Backbone.Collection.extend({ model : Item }); var ItemView = Backbone.View.extend({ el : $('.content'), initialize : function() { this.collection = new Album(images); this.render(); $('#filter').append(this.createSelect()); this.on("change:filterType", this.filterByType); this.collection.on('reset', this.render, this); }, template : $('#img_container').text(), render : function() { var tmpl = _.template(this.template); _.each(this.collection.models, function (item) { this.$el.append(tmpl(item.toJSON())); },this); }, events: { "change #filter select" : "setFilter" }, getTypes: function () { return _.uniq(this.collection.pluck("tags"), false, function (tags) { return tags.toLowerCase(); }); }, createSelect: function () { var filter = this.$el.find("#filter"), select = $("&lt;select/&gt;", { html: "&lt;option&gt;All&lt;/option&gt;" }); _.each(this.getTypes(), function (item) { var option = $("&lt;option/&gt;", { value: item.toLowerCase(), text: item.toLowerCase() }).appendTo(select); }); return select; }, setFilter: function (e) { this.filterType = e.currentTarget.value; this.trigger("change:filterType"); }, filterByType: function () { if (this.filterType === "all") { this.collection.reset(images); } else { this.collection.reset(images, { silent: true }); var filterType = this.filterType, filtered = _.filter(this.collection.models, function (item) { return item.get("tags").toLowerCase() === filterType; }); this.collection.reset(filtered); } } }); var i = new ItemView(); })(jQuery); </code></pre>
19871021	0	What is event.preventDefault preventing despite the event? <p>One goal of my main controller is to prevent users from going to urls of other users. That works perfectly fine with listening on $locationChangeStart and using its events preventDefault method. Unfortunately calling this method has the strange side effect of somehow "interrupting" the work of the function "handleNotification" which has the goal of notifying the user for 2 seconds that she or he has done something illegitimate. If I comment out event.preventDefault(), everything works as expected. So my question is: What is the 'scope' of the 'default' preventDefault prevents that I don't have on my mind and which keeps the handleNotification function from working properly? </p> <pre><code>$scope.$on('$locationChangeStart', function(event, newUrl, oldUrl) { ifUserIs('loggedIn', function() { if (newUrl.split('#/users/')[1] !== $scope.user.userId) { handleNotification('alert', 'You are not allowed to go here.'); event.preventDefault(); } }); }); function handleNotification (type, message) { $scope.notice = { content: message, type: type }; $timeout(function() { delete $scope.notice; return true; }, 2000); } </code></pre>

7829312	0	Why can't post scores via Scores API in Javascript? <p>I'm writing a javascript game library that I want to integrate with Facebook Scores. Games made with my library typically run on static file servers (i.e. just ordinary HTML+JS, no server side scripts).</p> <p>I've been looking at the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/score/" rel="nofollow">scores documentation</a> and have come across <a href="http://facebook.stackoverflow.com/questions/7211438/how-to-post-a-score-from-the-facebook-javascript-sdk">this problem</a>: you can only submit a score with an app access token.</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems I can't get an app access token unless I have the app secret, and it seems obvious I should not put the app secret in javascript. For most of these games, server side scripting is out of the question. So I have no way to get an app access token, so none of these games can submit scores.</p> <p>What seems especially dumb is if the user grants the app the "publish_stream" permission, you can automatically make a wall post along the lines of "I just scored 77777 in MySuperGame!". You can do that with just pure HTML+JS. But you can't post a score.</p> <p>Am I missing something or is the API just a bit dumb about this?</p>

30422729	0	Performance difference between member function and global function in release version <p>I have implemented two functions to perform the cross product of two Vectors (not std::vector), one is a member function and another is a global one, here is the key codes(additional parts are ommitted)</p> <pre><code>//for member function template &lt;typename Scalar&gt; SquareMatrix&lt;Scalar,3&gt; Vector&lt;Scalar,3&gt;::outerProduct(const Vector&lt;Scalar,3&gt; &amp;vec3) const { SquareMatrix&lt;Scalar,3&gt; result; for(unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) for(unsigned int j = 0; j &lt; 3; ++j) result(i,j) = (*this)[i]*vec3[j]; return result; } //for global function: Dim = 3 template&lt;typename Scalar, int Dim&gt; void outerProduct(const Vector&lt;Scalar, Dim&gt; &amp; v1 , const Vector&lt;Scalar, Dim&gt; &amp; v2, SquareMatrix&lt;Scalar, Dim&gt; &amp; m) { for (unsigned int i=0; i&lt;Dim; i++) for (unsigned int j=0; j&lt;Dim; j++) { m(i,j) = v1[i]*v2[j]; } } </code></pre> <p>They are almost the same except that one is a member function having a return value and another is a global function where the values calculated are straightforwardly assigned to a square matrix, thus requiring no return value. <br> Actually, I was meant to replace the member one by the global one to improve the performance, since the first one involes copy operations. The strange thing, however, is that <strong>the time cost by the global function is almost two times longer than the member one.</strong> Furthermore, I find that the execution of</p> <pre><code>m(i,j) = v1[i]*v2[j]; // in global function </code></pre> <p>requires much more time than that of</p> <pre><code>result(i,j) = (*this)[i]*vec3[j]; // in member function </code></pre> <p>So the question is, how does this performance difference between member and global function arise? </p> <p>Anyone can tell the reasons? <br> Hope I have presented my question clearly, and sorry to my poor english!</p> <p>//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> More information added:<br> The following is the codes I use to test the performance:</p> <pre><code> //the codes below is in a loop Vector&lt;double, 3&gt; vec1; Vector&lt;double, 3&gt; vec2; Timer timer; timer.startTimer(); for (unsigned int i=0; i&lt;100000; i++) { SquareMatrix&lt;double,3&gt; m = vec1.outerProduct(vec2); } timer.stopTimer(); std::cout&lt;&lt;"time cost for member function: "&lt;&lt; timer.getElapsedTime()&lt;&lt;std::endl; timer.startTimer(); SquareMatrix&lt;double,3&gt; m; for (unsigned int i=0; i&lt;100000; i++) { outerProduct(vec1, vec2, m); } timer.stopTimer(); std::cout&lt;&lt;"time cost for global function: "&lt;&lt; timer.getElapsedTime()&lt;&lt;std::endl; std::system("pause"); </code></pre> <p>and the result captured:<br> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MtPLB.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>You can see that the member funtion is almost twice faster than the global one.<br><br> Additionally, my project is built upon a 64bit windows system, and the codes are in fact used to generate the static lib files based on the Scons construction tools, along with vs2010 project files produced.</p> <p>I have to remind that <strong>the strange performance difference only occurs in a release version, while in a debug build type, the global function is almost five times faster than the member one.(about 0.10s vs 0.02s)</strong></p>

But I can't take ownership or make the new bucket public. I need to be able to make changes as I was able to in the old account. New account is totally unrelated to new account. It looks like files are retaining permissions and they are still owned by the old account. </p> <p>How can I set permissions in order to gain full access to files with the new account?</p>

Here's the full code that I tried originally:</p> <pre><code>dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_LOW,0), ^{ UIImage* img = [[UIImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFile: path]; dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ imageView = [[[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage: img] autorelease]; imageView.contentMode = UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill; CGRect photoFrame = self.frame; imageView.frame = photoFrame; [self addSubview:imageView]; }); }); </code></pre> <p>I simplified it so that I was running everything inside the main queue, but even then it didn't work.

Just not in my current project. So I'll have to do some slow, painful process of elimination work to figure out what's going wrong.

3596523	0	Is it possible to read an LLVM bitcode file into an llvm::Module? <p>I'm writing a compiler with LLVM. Each source file is compiled into an LLVM bitcode file. Eventually the linker links and optimizes all the bitcode files into one final binary.</p> <p>I need a way to read the bitcode files in the compiler in order to access the type information. The LLVM documentation shows a class called <code>BitcodeReader</code>, but that appears to be internal to LLVM.</p> <p>Is there any publicly accessible way to read a bitcode file into an <code>llvm::Module</code>?</p>

9936386	0	How to draw into PDF on iOS? <p>I am trying to find a way to allow the user to annotate (i.e. free form drawing) an existing PDF file in iOS, but the only approach that I have found seems extraordinarily cumbersome.</p> <p>The solution is in Monotouch, but I can translate from Objective-C if needed. This will also mean that many of the method and property names may not be completely familiar to non-Monotouch developers, but I am just looking for an approach.</p> <p>I currently have code that allows users to annotate images (jpg, png) using the TouchesMoved and TouchesBegan events on a UIView. This works well and accomplishes what I need.</p> <p>However, when working with an existing PDF file, it seems that the majority of the CGPDF functionality is centered around creating new files rather than editing existing ones.</p> <p>The only approach that I have been able to come up with is the following:</p> <ol> <li><p>When the UIView is opened, create a temporary file and set the PDF context to that file (UIGraphics.BeginPDFContext(filename)).</p></li> <li><p>Create a new CGPDFDocument from the original file and then draw each page from the original PDF into the current context, which will be the new temporary file.</p></li> <li><p>Destroy the original PDF document created in step 2.</p></li> <li><p>Show the user the first page and then let them draw on it, with the drawing commands being sent to the new file's context. There will also be methods to allow the user to change pages.</p></li> <li><p>When the user is done, close the PDF context, which will save all of the annotations to the new PDF file.</p></li> </ol> <p>This seems like it has the potential to be an enormous memory and performance hog, so I am wondering if there is any other way to approach this?</p>

1279656	0	Cocoa/Objective-C: how much optimization should I do myself? <p>I recently found myself writing a piece of code that executed a Core Data fetch, then allocated two mutable arrays with the initial capacity being equal to the number of results returned from the fetch:</p> <pre><code>// Have some existing context, request, and error objects NSArray *results = [context executeFetchRequest:request error:&error]; NSMutableArray *firstArray = [[[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:[results count]] autorelease]; NSMutableArray *secondArray = [[[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:[results count]] autorelease];</code></pre> <p>I looked this over again once I'd written it, and something struck me as odd: I was calling <code>[results count]</code> twice. The resultset is potentially pretty large (hundreds, maybe a thousand, objects).</p> <p>My first instict was to break out <code>[results count]</code> into a separate NSUInteger, then use that integer for the capacity of each of the arrays. My question: is this kind of by-hand optimization necessary? Will the compiler recognize it's running <code>[results count]</code> twice and just hold the value without me having to explicitly specify that behavior? Or will it run the method twice - a potentially costly operation?</p> <p>In a similar vein, what other optimizations should programmers (especially iPhone programmers, where there's a limited amount of memory/processing power available) do by hand, as opposed to trusting the compiler?</p>

40786590	0	Java 8 type inference cause to omit generic type on invocation <p>I have a Problem with a generic method after upgrading to Java 1.8, which was fine with Java 1.6 and 1.7 Consider the following code: </p> <pre><code>public class ExtraSortList&lt;E&gt; extends ArrayList&lt;E&gt; { ExtraSortList(E... elements) { super(Arrays.asList(elements)); } public List&lt;E&gt; sortedCopy(Comparator&lt;? super E&gt; c) { List&lt;E&gt; sorted = new ArrayList&lt;E&gt;(this); Collections.sort(sorted, c); return sorted; } public static void main(String[] args) { ExtraSortList&lt;String&gt; stringList = new ExtraSortList&lt;&gt;("foo", "bar"); Comparator&lt;? super String&gt; compGen = null; String firstGen = stringList.sortedCopy(compGen).get(0); // works fine Comparator compRaw = null; String firstRaw = stringList.sortedCopy(compRaw).get(0); // compiler ERROR: Type mismatch: cannot convert from Object to String } } </code></pre> <p>I tried this with the Oracle javac (1.8.0_92) and with Eclipse JDT (4.6.1) compiler. It is the same result for both. (the error message is a bit different, but essentially the same)</p> <p>Beside the fact, that it is possible to prevent the error by avoiding raw types, it puzzles me, because i don't understand the reason.</p> <p>Why does the raw method parameter of the sortedCopy-Method have any effect on the generic type of the return value? The generic type is already defined at class level. The method does not define a seperate generic type. The reference <code>list</code> is typed to <code>&lt;String&gt;</code>, so should the returned List.</p> <p>Why does Java 8 discard the generic type from the class on the return value?</p> <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> If the method signature of sortedCopy is changed (as pointed out by biziclop) to</p> <pre><code>public List&lt;E&gt; sortedCopy(Comparator c) { </code></pre> <p>then the compiler does consider the generic type <code>E</code> from the type <code>ExtraSortList&lt;E&gt;</code> and no error appears. But now the parameter <code>c</code> is a raw type and thus the compiler cannot validate the generic type of the provided Comparator.</p> <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I did some review of the Java Language Specification and now i think about, whether i have a lack of understanding or this is a flaw in the compiler. Because:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-6.html#jls-6.3" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Scope of a Declaration">Scope of a Declaration</a> of the generic type <code>E</code> is the class <code>ExtraSortList</code>, this includes the method <code>sortedCopy</code>.</li> <li>The method <code>sortedCopy</code> itself does <em>not declare</em> a generic type variable, it just refers to the type variable <code>E</code> from the class scope. see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.4" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Generic Methods">Generic Methods</a> in the JLS</li> <li>The JLS also states in the same section <blockquote> <p>Type arguments may not need to be provided explicitly when a generic method is invoked, as they can often be inferred (§18 (Type Inference)).</p> </blockquote></li> <li>The reference <code>stringList</code> is defined with <code>String</code>, thus the compiler does not need to infer a type for<code>E</code> on the invocation of <code>sortedCopy</code> because it is already defined.</li> <li>Because <code>stringList</code> already has a reified type for <code>E</code>, the parameter <code>c</code> should be <code>Comparator&lt;? super String&gt;</code> for the given invocation.</li> <li>The return type should also use the already reified type <code>E</code>, thus it should be <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>.</li> </ul> <p>This is my current understanding of how i think the Java compiler should evaluate the invocation. If i am wrong, an explanation why my assumptions are wrong would be nice.</p>

38255048	0	Separating axes from plot area in MATLAB <p>I find that data points that lie on or near the axes are difficult to see. The obvious fix, of course, is to simply change the plot area using <code>axis([xmin xmax ymin ymax])</code>, but this is not preferable in all cases; for example, if the x axis is time, then moving the minimum x value to -1 to show activity at 0 does not make sense. </p> <p>Instead, I was hoping to simply move the x and y axes away from the plot area, like I have done here: <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WzkUw.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WzkUw.png" alt="left: Matlab generated, right: desired (image editing software)"></a> left: MATLAB generated, right: desired (image editing software) </p> <p>Is there a way to automatically do this in MATLAB?

Currently we are uploading to S3 and the app references those (<code>the.s3.url.com/ourbucket/built.js</code>), but now that we are setting up dev, staging, and prod envs we can reference <code>built.js</code> since there can be up to 3 versions of it. </p> <p>Also, there's a timespan where the files are uploaded and the app is rolling out and the static assets don't work with the two versions up on the servers (i.e. built.js works with app version 0.0.2 but server one is deploy 0.0.1 and server two is running version 0.0.2)</p> <p>How do keep track of these mismatches or is there a way to just deploy a static assets to the EB instance directly.</p>
2271532	0	Android: Forcing a WebView to a certain height (or triggering scrolling for a div) <p>I am building an app which contains an input form and a WebView. The project is available at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-sap-note-viewer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://code.google.com/p/android-sap-note-viewer/</a></p> <p>The WebView will render a website based on the input and this page has a DIV with the main contents (could be hundreds of lines). I have no control of the contents on the website.</p> <p>Android WebKit doesn't seem to do any scrolling in a DIV, ref <a href="http://www.gregbugaj.com/?p=147" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gregbugaj.com/?p=147</a>. Therefore, only parts of the DIV is shown to the user, with no method of retrieving the rest of the text. <strong>My challenge is to find a way that all the text of the DIV is shown</strong>.</p> <p>My view is defined as the following: </p> <pre><code> &lt;LinearLayout android:orientation="horizontal" android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="wrap_content"&gt; &lt;TextView android:layout_width="wrap_content" android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceMedium" android:layout_height="wrap_content" android:text="@string/lblNote" /&gt; &lt;EditText android:id="@+id/txtNote" android:layout_width="wrap_content" android:layout_height="wrap_content" android:layout_weight="1" android:numeric="decimal" android:maxLength="10" /&gt; &lt;Button android:id="@+id/bView" android:text="@string/bView" android:layout_width="wrap_content" android:layout_height="wrap_content" /&gt; &lt;/LinearLayout&gt; &lt;WebView android:id="@+id/webview" android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="wrap_content" android:isScrollContainer="false" android:keepScreenOn="false" android:minHeight="4096px" /&gt; &lt;/LinearLayout&gt; </code></pre> <p>Here I've tried to hardcode the WebView to a large height in order to make sure the DIV is stretched out and shows all the text, and also force the LinearLayout to do the scrolling.</p> <p>However, the WebView is always adapting to the screen size (which would be good in most cases, but not this).</p> <p><strong>Any ideas on how to solve this problem?</strong></p> <p>(only solution I see now is to fetch the HTML myself, remove the DIV and send it to the WebView)</p>

21174310	0	Loop with trigger (which contains animation) not working <p>So I seem to have run into a bit of a dead end. I'm making a page which has an image slider. The slider has three images, one centered on the screen, the other two overflow on the left and right. When you click on the button to advance the slides it runs this code.... </p> <pre><code>$('#slideRight').click(function() { if ($('.container').is(':animated')) {return false;} var next=parseInt($('.container img:last-of-type').attr('id')) + 1; if (next == 12) { next = 0; } var diff = galsize() - 700; if ($('.thumbs').css("left") == "0px") { var plus = 78; } else { var plus = 0; } var app='&lt;img id="' + next + '" src="' + imgs[next].src + '"&gt;'; $('.container').width('2800px').append(app); $('.container').animate({marginLeft: (diff + plus) + "px"}, 300, function() { $('.container img:first-of-type').remove(); $('.container').width('2100px').css("margin-left", (galsize() + plus) + "px"); }); }); // end right click </code></pre> <p>This works just fine, not a problem..... I also have an interval set up to run this automatically every 5 seconds to form a slideshow...</p> <pre><code>var slideShow = setInterval(function() { $('#slideRight').trigger("click"); }, 5000); </code></pre> <p>This also works perfectly, not a problem.... However my problem is this.... I have thumbnails, when you click on a thumbnail, it should run this code until the current picture is the same as the thumbnail.... here is the code....</p> <pre><code>$('img.thumbnail').click(function() { clearInterval(slideShow); var src = $(this).attr("src"); while ($('.container img:eq(1)').attr('src') != src) { $('#slideRight').trigger("click"); } }); </code></pre> <p>When I click on the thumbnail nothing happens... I've used alert statements to try and debug, what ends up happening is this.... </p> <p>The while loop executes, however nothing happens the first time. The slide is not advanced at all. Starting with the second execution, the is('::animated') is triggered EVERY TIME and the remainder of the slideRight event is not executed...</p> <p>So my first problem, can anyone shed some light on why it doesn't run the first time?</p> <p>And my second question, is there any way to wait until the animation is complete before continuing with the loop?</p> <p>Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!</p>
37699538	0	How to immediately know if connection is lost with Socket.IO? <p>I'm working on a project that includes BeagleBoneBlack and web server written in NodeJs. The idea is that when Beaglebone detects something from enviroment sends it to web server, and if connection is lost for some reason BBB stores the log in it's own database.</p> <p>So I use SocketIO, and I emit when BBB detects something. I use flag variable isConnected that I put on false on "disconnect" event, and if isConnected is false I'm not emiting to server, just writing in database. </p> <p>Problem is that when computer, where server is running, goes to sleep (simulating lost connection), SocketIo needs sometimes more than a minute to detect that connection is lost, and emit disconnect event. Is there any way to get this info faster, because the program tries to send readings to server and can't, but it's not written in database. </p>

5248219	0	about number of bits required for Fibonacci number <p>I am reading a algorithms book by S.DasGupta. Following is text snippet from the text regarding number of bits required for nth Fibonacci number.</p> <blockquote> <p>It is reasonable to treat addition as a single computer step if small numbers are being added, 32-bit numbers say. But the nth Fibonacci number is about 0.694n bits long, and this can far exceed 32 as n grows. Arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large numbers cannot possibly be performed in a single, constant-time step.</p> </blockquote> <p>My question is for eg, for Fibonacci number F1 = 1, F2 =1, F3=2, and so on. then substituting "n" in above formula i.e., 0.694n for F1 is approximately 1, F2 is approximately 2 bits, but for F3 and so on above formula fails.

I've been using Gulp and Rollup, but the SCSS/Chunking along side of the tree shaking is a nice thing. </p> <p>It takes around 4000 - 5000ms to compile the build, which wouldn't be the end of the world except the project is so small, so I'm worried about that becoming much larger as a project grows.</p> <p>I've tried a couple things to improve the speed.</p> <pre><code>resolve : { root: path.resolve(__dirname,'src') } </code></pre> <p>This did help, reducing the time by a couple hundred ms, so that was great. I tried to take this further by also resolving alias, but that didn't really show any gains as far as I could tell.</p> <p>I set devTool to eval as well. Beyond this I haven't really been able to improve things, but I'm sure it's something in the way I've set things up. It's worth noting that while 'webpack' compiles the build, running the webpack-dev-server doesn't. It's starts up, hangs on the compile and then crashes. This may or may not be a separate issue, but I thought it was worth including. </p> <p>I'm also using ES6 System.import for chunking (just as a note).</p> <p>I put the project up on git, so feel free to pull it down: <a href="https://github.com/loriensleafs/trying-out-webpack2" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/loriensleafs/trying-out-webpack2</a></p> <p>The webpack.config.js is:</p> <pre><code>var path = require('path'), webpack = require('webpack'), CleanPlugin = require('clean-webpack-plugin'), ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin'), production = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'; var plugins = [ new ExtractTextPlugin({ filename: 'bundle.css', allChunks: true}), new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({ name : 'vendor', children : true, minChunks : 2 }) ]; if (production) { plugins = plugins.concat([ new CleanPlugin('builds'), new webpack.optimize.DedupePlugin(), new webpack.optimize.OccurenceOrderPlugin(), new webpack.optimize.MinChunkSizePlugin({ minChunkSize: 51200, // ~50kb }), new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({ mangle: true, compress: { warnings: false, // Suppress uglification warnings }, }), new webpack.DefinePlugin({ __SERVER__ : !production, __DEVELOPMENT__ : !production, __DEVTOOLS__ : !production, 'process.env': { BABEL_ENV: JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV), } }) ]); } module.exports = { // debug : !production, devTool : production ? false : 'eval', entry : './src', output : { path : 'builds', filename : 'bundle.js', chunkFilename : 'chunk.js', publicPath : 'builds/' }, resolve : { root: path.resolve(__dirname,'src') }, plugins : plugins, module : { loaders: [ { test : /\.(png|gif|jpe?g|svg)$/i, loader : 'url', query : { limit: 10000 } }, { test : /\.js$/, include : /src/, exclude : /node_modules/, loader : 'babel' }, { test : /\.scss$/, include : /src/, exclude : /node_modules/, loader : ExtractTextPlugin.extract(['css','sass']) }, { test : /\.html$/, loader : 'html' } ] } }; </code></pre> <p>Thanks for any advice/help folks have on this. If there's any other helpful info I can post on here please let me know.</p>

I could do this with <code>coord_cartesian()</code> if they weren't faceted or if I wanted to zoom on all plots, but don't have a good solution in this case. I suppose I could subset the data first, but that is taboo for good reason (e.g. would throw off any statistical layer, etc). </p> <p>(Note that the question is related to this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6574188/r-ggplot2-how-can-i-independently-adjust-the-x-axis-limits-on-a-facet-grid">R: {ggplot2}: How / Can I independently adjust the x-axis limits on a facet_grid plot?</a> but the answer there will not work for this purpose.)</p>

(while (dAmount != (2*dbAmount))) Also, the first calculation isn't correct o.O <p>My friend and I are learning C++, and we can't seem to get this program running as it should be. So basically, what we are now attempting, is a tasks that requires us to script a program in which the user is asked two variables. One of these variables is a tax percentage (in the form of 1.X) and the other is any positive, real number. Now what it is we need to know, is why our condition isn't prompting? We would really appreciate an answer to our question. Here is the code:</p> <pre><code> #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;iomanip&gt; #include &lt;ctype.h&gt; #include &lt;math.h&gt; #include &lt;cstdlib&gt; using namespace std; int main() { double dTax; double dbAmount; double dAmount; cout &lt;&lt; "Tax? (In the form of 1.05)" &lt;&lt; endl; cin &gt;&gt; dTax; cout &lt;&lt; "Amount?" &lt;&lt; endl; cin &gt;&gt; dbAmount; cout &lt;&lt; dbAmount &lt;&lt; " is the amount without taxes incalculated." &lt;&lt; endl; dAmount = (dbAmount*dTax); while (dAmount != (2*dbAmount)) { dAmount = (dAmount*dTax); cout &lt;&lt; dAmount &lt;&lt; " is the next amount, with taxes incalculated." &lt;&lt; endl; break; } cin.get(); return 0; } </code></pre>

9763404	0	SaaS Platform - Different database user for each user or one master account <p>I have a SaaS platform that I am working on; written in PHP and using a MySQL database (using the PHP PDO class).</p> <p>The application is already functional and I have decided to use a separate database for each instance.</p> <p>One of the reasons for using multiple databases is to ensure that client data is separated (and hopefully secure). This also allows us to easily transfer their instance into the on-premise version.</p> <p>Security is always something that I worry about. I want to ensure this system is as secure as possible before it goes live.</p> <p>Currently we are using a single MySQL username &amp; password that has access to every database (on that specific MySQL Farm).</p> <p>Theoretically if there was a security breach then the attacker might be able to access a different database (username &amp; password is unset after the PDO/Database connection is made, but they might be able to run a query such as "use databaseB").</p> <p>Is this something that I should be concerned about? For example a SaaS platform that simply uses database partitioning is already less secure as a simple SQL error could expose client data.</p> <p>I've already started looking into using different database usernames &amp; passwords, but it does add to the complexity of the SaaS platform, and keeping things simple is always a good idea.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <hr> <p>I have decided to go with different usernames and password for each instance.</p> <p>This is another layer of security and that cannot hurt.</p>

13211993	0	Estimating the variance of eigenvalues of sample covariance matrices in Matlab <p>I am trying to investigate the statistical variance of the eigenvalues of sample covariance matrices using Matlab. To clarify, each <strong>sample</strong> covariance matrix is constructed from a <strong>finite</strong> number of vector snapshots (afflicted with random white Gaussian noise). Then, over a <strong>large</strong> number of trials, a large number of such matrices are generated and eigendecomposed in order to estimate the <strong>theoretical</strong> statistics of the eigenvalues.</p> <p>According to several sources (see, for example, [1, Eq.3] and [2, Eq.11]), the variance of each <strong>sample</strong> eigenvalue should be equal to that <strong>theoretical</strong> eigenvalue squared, divided by the number of vector snapshots used for each covariance matrix. However, the results I get from Matlab aren't even close.</p> <p>Is this an issue with my code? With Matlab? (I've never had such trouble working on similar problems).</p> <p>Here's a very simple example:</p> <pre><code>% Data vector length Lvec = 5; % Number of snapshots per sample covariance matrix N = 200; % Number of simulation trials Ntrials = 10000; % Noise variance sigma2 = 10; % Theoretical covariance matrix Rnn_th = sigma2*eye(Lvec); % Theoretical eigenvalues (should all be sigma2) lambda_th = sort(eig(Rnn_th),'descend'); lambda = zeros(Lvec,Ntrials); for trial = 1:Ntrials % Generate new (complex) white Gaussian noise data n = sqrt(sigma2/2)*(randn(Lvec,N) + 1j*randn(Lvec,N)); % Sample covariance matrix Rnn = n*n'/N; % Save sample eigenvalues lambda(:,trial) = sort(eig(Rnn),'descend'); end % Estimated eigenvalue covariance matrix b = lambda - lambda_th(:,ones(1,Ntrials)); Rbb = b*b'/Ntrials % Predicted (approximate) theoretical result Rbb_th_approx = diag(lambda_th.^2/N) </code></pre> <p>References:</p> <p>[1] Friedlander, B.; Weiss, A.J.; , "<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/112067632" rel="nofollow">On the second-order statistics of the eigenvectors of sample covariance matrices</a>," Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on , vol.46, no.11, pp.3136-3139, Nov 1998 [2] Kaveh, M.; Barabell, A.; , "<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/112046406/Kaveh-86" rel="nofollow">The statistical performance of the MUSIC and the minimum-norm algorithms in resolving plane waves in noise</a>," Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on , vol.34, no.2, pp. 331- 341, Apr 1986</p>

29126463	0	Angularjs $scope is confusing me <p>I really need some help here... I´m trying for hours now and can´t get it to work...</p> <p>I have a .json file with 100 products like this:</p> <pre><code>[{ "ean": "3613132010420", "brand": "NewBrand", "desc": "A description", "feature1": "", "feature2": "", "feature3": "", "feature4": "", "feature5": "", "img": "", "metric": { "gender": "female", }, "score":"" }, { "ean": "3613132010420", "brand": "NewBrand", "desc": "A description", "feature1": "", "feature2": "", "feature3": "", "feature4": "", "feature5": "", "img": "", "metric": { "gender": "female", }, "score":"" }] </code></pre> <p>I read the json with $http and put everything in $scope.products. The data is shown in a list, everything is fine. Now I want to filter the products and alter the score variable (after swipe on a option slider). </p> <p>The view should then also be updated due to the angular data-binding.</p> <p>How can I change this variable in the $scope? This is what I tried and nothing works:</p> <pre><code>$('.find-style-slider .slick-list').bind('touchstart click', function(){ angular.forEach($scope.products, function(value, key) { $scope.products[key].score = '25'; //nothing happens var obj = { score: '25' }; $scope.products[key].push(obj); //Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function $scope.products.splice(key, 0, obj); //no error but $scope variable does not change $scope.products[key].unshift(obj); //Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function }); }); </code></pre> <p>Do I need to update something or $apply()? I would be thankful for any help/hint...</p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> I think the $scope is not working like I thought.... I fill the $scope.products with a service:</p> <pre><code>productService.initDb().then(function(products) { $scope.products = products; }); </code></pre> <p>When I put this </p> <pre><code> var obj = { score: '25' }; $scope.products.splice(0, 0, obj); </code></pre> <p>INSIDE the initDb function then the first elements gets updated! But not outside.</p> <p>The question is now: WHY? And how can I access the $scope.products from outside the service function?</p> <p>I thought the $scope is the same for the whole controller... <em>confused</em></p>
6342781	0	javax.validation.ConstraintValidationException: validation failed for classes <p>I am developing a web application using <code>Spring 3.1</code>, <code>Hibernate 3</code> and <code>Hibernate Validator</code> 4 in the backend. I'm using <code>JSR 303</code> for the validation. This is done via annotations in the domain class.</p> <pre><code> public class StaffMember implements Serializable { @NotNull @Size(max = 30) // All letters, spaces and hyphens are allowed @Pattern(regexp = "^[^0-9_.]+$", message = ("Es sind nur Buchstaben, Leerzeichen und Bindestrich erlaubt.")) private String firstname; } </code></pre> <p>I have written a test class for testing the CRUD operations in the DAO class. This class runs without errors for valid data. Now I want to edit an existing object. Therefore I change the first name. I specify an invalid name because I want to write a negative test case.</p> <pre><code>// Allows Spring to configure the test @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) // Define which configuration should be used @ContextConfiguration(locations = { "classpath:portal-test.xml" }) @TransactionConfiguration(transactionManager = "transactionManager", defaultRollback=false) // All methods are transactional @Transactional public class StaffMemberDAOTest { private StaffMember staffMember, nextStaffMember; @Autowired private StaffMemberDAO staffMemberDao; @Autowired private Validator validator; @Test(expected = ConstraintViolationException.class) @Transactional @Rollback(true) public void testUpdateStaffMemberWithInvalidData() { System.out.println("--- update a staffMember (with invalid data) ---"); // check if database is empty Assert.assertEquals(0, staffMemberDao.getAllStaffMembers().size()); // add staffMember createStaffMember(); // validate Set&lt;ConstraintViolation&lt;StaffMember&gt;&gt; violations = validator .validate(staffMember); // object is valid if(violations.size() == 0) { staffMemberDao.addStaffMember(staffMember); } else { System.out.println("Object is not valid."); } // get staffMember StaffMember staffMemberExpected = staffMemberDao.getStaffMember(staffMember.getStaffMemberID()); // check data Assert.assertEquals(staffMember, staffMemberExpected); // edit data staffMemberExpected.setFirstname("George No 1"); // validate Set&lt;ConstraintViolation&lt;StaffMember&gt;&gt; violationsUpdate = validator .validate(staffMemberExpected); // object is valid if(violationsUpdate.size() == 0) { staffMemberDao.editStaffMember(staffMemberExpected); } else { System.out.println("Object is not valid."); } } </code></pre> <p>The system rightly raises the following error message: javax.validation.ConstraintValidationException In this case the expected exception must to be indicated.

6995738	0	ASP javascript radiobutton enable disable not included in postback ajax <p>Here is the problem. I have a radiobutton group (two radiobuttons).</p> <p>These guys are initialy disabled. When the user clicks a checkbox, I dynamically enable radiobuttons in javascript by setting <code>rbtn.disabled = false;</code> and doing the same for it's parent (span element) so it correctly works in IE. The problem is that these dynamically enabled radiobuttons are not returned on postback (I see <code>rbtn.Checked == false</code> on serverside and <code>request.form</code> does not contain proper value).</p> <p>Why is this happening? Is there another fix except for a workaround with hidden fields?</p> <p>Expected answer decribes post-back policy, why/how decides which fields are included in postback and fix to this problem.</p>

6334498	0	Recognize "Invalid" URLs without Trying to Resolve Them <p>I'm building a Facebook App which grabs the URLs from various sources in a user's Facebook acount--e.g., a user's likes.</p> <p>A problem I've encountered is that many Facebook entries have string which are not URLs in their "website" and "link" fields. Facebook does no checking on user input so these fields can essentially contain any string.</p> <p>I want to be able to process the strings in these field such that URLs like <code>"http://google.com"</code>, <code>"https://www.bankofamerica.com"</code>, <code>"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/us/13fbi.html?_r=1&amp;hp"</code>, <code>"bit.ly"</code>, <code>"www.pbs.org"</code> are all accepted.</p> <p>And all the strings like <code>"here is a random string of text the user entered"</code>, <code>"here'\s ano!!! #%#$^ther weird random string"</code> are all rejected.</p> <p>It seems to me the only way to be "sure" of a URL is to attempt to resolve it, but I believe that will be prohibitively resource intensive.</p> <p>Can anyone think of clever way to regex or otherwise analyze these strings such that "a lot" of the URLS are properly captured--80%? 95% 99.995% of URLs?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <hr> <p>EDIT: FYI, I'm developing in Python.

21392529	0	Cascading multi-value parameter issue in SSRS 2008 <p>Basically I have built a report using SSRS 2008, the report has cascading parameters, the independent one is a multi-value parameter (work units) populated with values from a database query, the dependent parameter (job positions contained in respective work units) also gets values from a query with a where clause as follows:</p> <pre><code>WHERE position.unitId IN (@units) </code></pre> <p>@units being the multi-value parameter. The default value for units is the query itself - all of which the user has access to. So upon opening the report, all available units are selected and all respective job positions are retrieved - works fine. But a aser can also have no access to any units, which makes the dependent query fail, cause no units were retrieved hence @units contains no values. I would have thought the query would not fire until @units has a value present.. anyways I have tried to check the contents of @units before querying for job positions in various ways:</p> <p>*replacing @units parameter with the following expression: =IIF(Parameters!units.Count = 0, "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", Parameters!units.Value)</p> <p>*having another parameter containing a comma seperated string of the @units values and checking if the lenght of that is greater than 0 before executing the dependent dataset, etc.</p> <p>But now, when I open up the report, the drop down list of job position is empty, disabled and remains so until the values of units are changed or the report is run. After that they refresh alright it seems. So my question is, what may be the cause of the control being disabled (units are retrieved, so why does an expression as a parameter value for job positions messes it up?) and how to deal with this the right way, can`t seem to find something really of the same nature online. </p> <p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

21274132	0	Produce an iCal appointment and subsequent updates via email but don't offer accept/decline options <p>We are writing a system that has a booking feature, and we are planning to have it send *.ics files via email to attendees so they can easily add appointments to their calendars. The types of events are things like training courses (e.g. 3pm in the boardroom).</p> <p>We've got this working to the point that the system sends the *.ics, and using Gmail and Outlook, the user can accept the appointment which, is then added to their calendar.</p> <p>Sometimes an event changes (e.g. a course is cancelled or delayed until the following day). Our software can send out a new *.ics file, and Gmail/Outlook correctly recognize that this is an update to the original appointment and gives the option to accept/decline again.</p> <p>The trouble is, we don't have a mechanism to receive via email the accept/decline responses that standard email clients automatically send when the user accepts/declines an appointment. Therefore, clicking the "decline" option could give them the false sense that they have cancelled the appointment when in fact our system has no idea what they've done within their calendar.</p> <p>We always want the bookings to be instigated by the user directly on the website, and the *.ics via email is merely a convenience to help them remember to attend. Similar to a flight booking, if the passenger really intends to cancel, something a little more definitive is required than clicking "decline" in Outlook. With a few flight bookings I've made, the carrier sent me a *.vcs file which contains "METHOD:PUBLISH" instead of "METHOD:REQUEST" which sounds closer to what we want, although in testing, this *.vcs file was not recognized by GMail as an appointment.</p> <p>So the question is, can we email appointments, with subsequent updates, that will be automatically be recognized by Outlook, GMail &amp; Lotus Notes, but prevent the user from thinking they can cancel/decline the entire booking from within their own calendar tool? If so, how?</p> <p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong></p> <p>I think I found the issue with the METHOD:PUBLISH airline booking example I was experimenting with - it was for a past date. Using a future date, We can now use METHOD:PUBLISH to allow people to add events to their calendar without requiring accept/decline. Problem now is that if the event is cancelled or changed, we cannot get a new *.ics to be recognized as overriding the original. We are allocating a unique UID and incrementing the SEQUENCE field to the event, but I don't know whether the spec allows a "PUBLISH"-ed event to elegantly handle updates (date, time, location, description etc.)</p> <p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p> <p>Okay, well I've just been experimenting with the sample *.ics files from the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5546" rel="nofollow">spec</a>. Using the examples from 4.1.1 "A Minimal Published Event" and 4.1.2 "Changing a Published Event" I am sending what I believe is a spec-compliant published event, and subsequent update. Both Outlook 2010 and GMail see the update as a NEW EVENT. So at this point I'm going to assume Outlook and GMail have only partial support for *.ics files, give up on elegant updates and simply instruct the user to delete their old calendar appointment if I send them a new one.</p>

33349822	0	Problems implementing an editable TableView<ObservableList<String> <p>So I've been trying to implement a TableView where you can edit a column just by clicking on it, and then save the edit by pressing the enter key. I've taken at lot of the code from the answer in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27900344/how-to-make-a-table-column-with-integer-datatype-editable-without-changing-it-to">this</a> thread. This is the result:</p> <pre><code>import com.sun.javafx.collections.ObservableListWrapper; import javafx.application.Application; import javafx.application.Platform; import javafx.beans.property.SimpleStringProperty; import javafx.collections.FXCollections; import javafx.collections.ObservableList; import javafx.scene.Scene; import javafx.scene.control.TableCell; import javafx.scene.control.TableColumn; import javafx.scene.control.TableView; import javafx.scene.control.TextField; import javafx.scene.input.KeyCode; import javafx.stage.Stage; public class TestEditableTable extends Application { public void start(Stage stage) { TableView&lt;ObservableList&lt;String&gt;&gt; tableView = new TableView&lt;ObservableList&lt;String&gt;&gt;(); tableView.setEditable(true); // Some dummy data.

But gives me a "Discouraged access: The type 'ObservableListWrapper&lt;String&gt;' is not API (restriction on required library 'C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_60\lib\ext\jfxrt.jar')". ObservableListWrapper&lt;String&gt; ob = ((ObservableListWrapper&lt;String&gt;) this.getTableRow().getItem()); ob.set(1, value); // I had to put this in a Platform.runLater(), otherwise the textfield remained open. Platform.runLater(() -&gt; { setText(value); setGraphic(null); }); } } } </code></pre> <p>And this program works OK. The cell is edited when you press the enter button. But there are two main issues with this:</p> <ol> <li><p>Once I've pressed enter and a cell has been edited. I can't edit it again by clicking on it. I need to press another row to be able to edit it again. Setting to focus on the parent of the row didn't do the trick.</p></li> <li><p>The code inside <code>commitEdit()</code> works. But it is ugly and using a <code>ObservableListWrapper</code> gives me the warning "Discouraged access: The type 'ObservableListWrapper' is not API (restriction on required library 'C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_60\lib\ext\jfxrt.jar')". Also the cell index is hard coded, which wont work if I use this in many different columns.</p></li> </ol> <p>None of the issues mentioned above is acceptable.</p> <p>The final implementation must support restriction of the input in the textfield. As far as I understand it this means that I need to have access to the <code>TextField</code> object displayed in the cell, as in my current implementation.</p>

2791931	1	Speed vs security vs compatibility over methods to do string concatenation in Python <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1225637/python-string-formatting">Similar</a> questions <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/376461/string-concatenation-vs-string-substitution-in-python/376508#376508">have been brought</a> (good speed comparison there) on this same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subject</a>. Hopefully this question is different and updated to Python <em>2.6</em> and <em>3.0</em>.</p> <p>So far I believe the faster and most compatible method (among different Python versions) is the plain simple <code>+</code> sign:</p> <pre><code>text = "whatever" + " you " + SAY </code></pre> <p>But I keep hearing and reading it's not secure and / or advisable.</p> <p>I'm not even sure how many methods are there to manipulate strings! I could count only about 4: There's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_interpolation#Interpolation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">interpolation</a> and all its sub-options such as <code>%</code> and <code>format</code> and then there's the simple ones, <code>join</code> and <code>+</code>.</p> <p>Finally, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/release/3.0.1/whatsnew/3.0.html#pep-3101-a-new-approach-to-string-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">new approach to string formatting</a>, which is with <code>format</code>, is certainly not good for backwards compatibility at same time making <code>%</code> not good for forward compatibility. But should it be used for every string manipulation, including every concatenation, whenever we restrict ourselves to 3.x only?</p> <p>Well, maybe this is more of a wiki than a question, but I do wish to have an answer on <strong>which is the proper usage of each string manipulation method</strong>. And which one could be generally used with each focus in mind (best all around for compatibility, for speed and for security).</p> <p>Thanks.</p> <p>edit: I'm not sure I should accept an answer if I don't feel it really answers the question... But my point is that all them 3 together do a proper job.</p> <p>Daniel's most voted answer is actually the one I'd prefer for accepting, if not for the "note". I highly disagree with <em>"concatenation is strictly using the + operator to concatenate strings"</em> because, for one, <code>join</code> does string concatenation as well, and we can build any arbitrary library for that.</p> <p><strong>All current 3 answers are valuable</strong> and I'd rather having some answer mixing them all. While nobody volunteer to do that, I guess by choosing the one less voted (but fairly broader than THC4k's, which is more like a large and very welcomed comment) I can draw attention to the others as well.</p>

It just goes back and forth a calendar's months replacing the html.

21359209	0	How to pass the asp.Identity object to a second register page <p>I am building a much more advanced registration process which consists of 3 pages, the first page is a form that grabs a username(email form) and a password with confirmation. The button click on this page creates the user in an unverified state in the db and redirects to the page where the profile is created. Once the create profile button is clicked and the profile is created in the db the redirect takes you to the Credit Card info page where the form is filled out, the credit card is verified and then that info is written to a table in the database.</p> <p>I have disabled the loggedin user display in the header so that I can use the registrants First and Last name which arent entered until the Credit Card page. Since the identityUser is required for the sign on and thus to populate the loggedin user control, how can I pass this object from page to page? </p> <p><strong>Code where original template was logging in the user</strong>: (Note:I commented out the sign in code)</p> <pre><code> Protected Sub CreateUser_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Dim userName As String = UserNameCtrl.Text Dim manager = New UserManager() Dim newuser = New IdentityUser() With {.UserName = userName} manager.UserValidator = New UserValidator(Of IdentityUser)(manager) With {.AllowOnlyAlphanumericUserNames = False} Dim result = manager.Create(newuser, Password.Text) If result.Succeeded Then Session("email") = newuser.UserName Session("userid") = newuser.Id.ToString() 'uncomment the code below if you want the auto sign in to occur 'IdentityHelper.SignIn(manager, newuser, isPersistent:=False) IdentityHelper.RedirectToReturnUrl(Page.ResolveUrl("~/Account/CreateProfile.aspx?Guid=" &amp; newuser.Id.ToString()), Response) Else ErrorMessage.Text = Encoder.HtmlEncode(result.Errors.FirstOrDefault()) End If End Sub </code></pre> <p>I now call this routine to sign in the user once the third page of the registration process is completed. (Session("userid") is the new registrants generated userid)</p> <pre><code> Private Sub SignInUserOnFormCompletion() Dim manager = New UserManager() manager.UserValidator = New UserValidator(Of IdentityUser)(manager) With {.AllowOnlyAlphanumericUserNames = False} Dim newuser = New IdentityUser() With {.Id = Session("userid").ToString()} IdentityHelper.SignIn(manager, newuser, isPersistent:=False) End Sub </code></pre> <p>The problem is the above doesnt work as the newuser somehow has different credentials. How can I pass the original newuser from the first page to the third page where I can use it in the SignInUserOnFormCompletion subroutine? Do I create a cookie and pass it around that way? This is a new topic for me so I'm not familiar with the proper methods to accomplish this.</p>

The <em>N</em> column vectors are unknown. There are 3 possible choices for each of the <em>N</em> column vectors - (1,0,0)', (0,1,0)', (0,0,1)'.</p> <p>So the <strong>first question</strong> is - </p> <p>How can we get all possible choices of this matrix <em>MAT</em> by keeping the row sums fixed as <em>(RS,LS,NCS)'</em> using R software ? </p> <p>For example - Take <em>N</em>=7, <em>RS</em>=sum of first row=2, <em>LS</em>=sum of second row=2 and <em>NCS</em>=sum of third row=3.

I can see the pictures, but when I click it opens another page just for the picture. </p> <p>I forgot to say that I have a third <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> conected into the navigation, a select command to retrieve data from database. The entire file is PHP.</p> <p>What can I do to mantain the lightbox effect?</p>

27260020	0	Why are Spock Speck tests so wordy? <p>Coming from JUnit background I don't really understand the point of all the text in spockD tests, since they don't show on the output from the test.</p> <p>So for example, if I have a constraint on a field Double foo with constraints foo max:5, nullable:false</p> <p>And I write tests like this:</p> <pre><code>void "test constraints" { when: "foo set to &gt; max" foo=6D then: "max validation fails" !foo.validate() when: "foo is null foo=null then: "null validation fails" !foo.validate() } </code></pre> <p>The test is well documented in its source, but if the validation fails, the error output doesn't take advantage of all this extra typing I've done to make my tests clear.</p> <p>All I get is</p> <pre><code>Failure: | test constraints(com.grapevine.FooSpec) | Condition not satisfied: f.validate() | | | false </code></pre> <p>But I can't tell form this report whether it failed the null constraint or the max constraint validation and I then need to check the line number of the failure in the test source. </p> <p>At least with JUnit I could do</p> <pre><code>foo=60D; assertFalse("contraints failed to block foo&gt;max", f.validate()); foo=null; assertFalse("contraints failed to block foo=null", f.validate()); </code></pre> <p>And then I'd get useful info back from in the failure report. Which seems to both more concise and gives a more informative test failure report. </p> <p>Is there some way get more robust error reporting out of Spec that take advantage of all this typing of when and then clauses so they show up on failure reports so you know what actually fails? Are these "when" and "then" text descriptors only serving as internal source documentation or are they used somewhere?</p>

I was able to get the id of the last insert, but in some of my tables the 'serial' attribute is not used. I was looking for a command similar to the following, but to get rowid instead of id.</p> <p><code>SELECT DBINFO ('sqlca.sqlerrd1') FROM systables WHERE tabid = 1;</code></p> <p>And yes, I do realize working with the rowid is dangerous because it is not constant. However, I plan to make my application force the client apps to reset the data if the table is altered in a way that the rowids got rearranged or the such.</p>

34087329	0	Categorical and ordinal feature data representation in regression analysis? <p>I am trying to fully understand difference between categorical and ordinal data when doing regression analysis. For now, what is clear:</p> <p><strong>Categorical feature and data example:</strong><br> Color: red, white, black <br> Why categorical: <code>red &lt; white &lt; black</code> is logically <strong>incorrect</strong></p> <p><strong>Ordinal feature and data example:</strong><br> Condition: old, renovated, new <br> Why ordinal: <code>old &lt; renovated &lt; new</code> is logically <strong>correct</strong></p> <p><strong>Categorical-to-numeric and ordinal-to-numeric encoding methods: <br></strong> One-Hot encoding for categorical data <br> Arbitrary numbers for ordinal data</p> <p><strong>Categorical data to numeric:</strong></p> <pre><code>data = {'color': ['blue', 'green', 'green', 'red']} </code></pre> <p>Numeric format after One-Hot encoding:</p> <pre><code> color_blue color_green color_red 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 3 0 0 1 </code></pre> <p><strong>Ordinal data to numeric:</strong></p> <pre><code>data = {'con': ['old', 'new', 'new', 'renovated']} </code></pre> <p>Numeric format after using mapping: Old &lt; renovated &lt; new → 0, 1, 2</p> <pre><code>0 0 1 2 2 2 3 1 </code></pre> <p>In my data I have 'color' feature. As color changes from white to black price increases. From above mentioned rules I probably have to use one-hot encoding for categorical 'color' data. But why I cannot use ordinal representation. Below I provided my observations from where my question arised.</p> <p>Let me start with introducing formula for linear regression: <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mbiK6.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mbiK6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a> <br>Let have a look at data representations for color: <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Veb54.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Veb54.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a> Let's predict price for 1-st and 2-nd item using formula for both data representations:<br> <strong>One-hot encoding:</strong> In this case different thetas for different colors will exist. I assume that thetas already derived from regression (20, 50 and 100). Prediction will be: </p> <pre><code>Price (1 item) = 0 + 20*1 + 50*0 + 100*0 = 20$ (thetas are assumed for example) Price (2 item) = 0 + 20*0 + 50*1 + 100*0 = 50$ </code></pre> <p><strong>Ordinal encoding for color:</strong> In this case all colors will have 1 common theta but my assigned multipliers (10, 20, 30) differ:</p> <pre><code>Price (1 item) = 0 + 20*10 = 200$ (theta assumed for example) Price (2 item) = 0 + 20*20 = 400$ (theta assumed for example) </code></pre> <p>In my model White &lt; Red &lt; Black in prices. Seem to be that correlation works correctly and it is logical predictions in both cases. For ordinal and categorical representations. So I can use any encoding for my regression regardless of the data type (categorical or ordinal)? This division in data representations is just a matter of conventions and software-oriented representations rather than a matter of regression logic itself?</p>
31256206	0	C++ memory alignment <p>So I read that when variables are declared in c++ if you want to get the optimum cache reads the memory should stick to its natural alignment. Example:</p> <pre><code>int a; // memory address should end in 0x0,0x4,0x8,0xC int b[2]; // 8 bytes 0x0,0x8 int b[4]; // 16 bytes 0x0 </code></pre> <p>But in practice these variables do not follow the "natural alignment" rules, a 16 byte variable was residing at a memory address that ended in 0xC.

25670049	0	Changing checkbox attributes for multiple rows with single checkbox <p>Good Morning,</p> <p>Im working on a larger project but i tried to do a simple page in order to check my work. php/mysql newb here. Sorry! :)</p> <p>What im trying to accomplish is ultimately having a single user page shown with rows of tasks from a table and a single check mark in order to say if the user has completed the task or not by checking or unchecking the box.</p> <p>For testing purposes, I have set up a table with rows labled testid, testdata and testcheck. The testid a INT(2)AutoIncrement and Primary and Unique, testdata is a VARCHAR(30) and testcheck is a TINYINT(1). The auto increment isnt really important because I manually populated all the rows. I have 5 rows (for the array sake) consisting of 1-5 testid, "testdata1-5" for testdata and either a 0 or a 1 for testcheck. The table is functioning fine and the database can be queried.</p> <p>Here is the code for the php start page:</p> <pre><code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;?php include_once('init.php'); $query = mysql_query("SELECT testid, testdata, testcheck FROM testtable"); ?&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Test form for checkmarks&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form method="POST" action="testover.php"&gt; &lt;table border="1"&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Test ID &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Test Data &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Checked &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Test Check &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;?php while ( $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($query)) { ?&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;?php echo $row['testid']; ?&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;?php echo $row['testdata']; ?&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" name="&lt;?php $row['testid'] ?&gt;" value="&lt;?php $row['testcheck']; ?&gt;" &lt;?php if($row['testcheck']=='1'){echo 'checked';} ?&gt;&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;?php echo $row['testcheck']; ?&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;?php } ?&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;input type="submit" name="confirm" value="Confirm Details"&gt; &lt;a href="testcheck.php"&gt;&lt;input type="button" value="Home"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre> <p>Ive been going back and forth trying to use an array for the inputs name (name="something[]") or the "isset" parameter but that is where my knowledge is failing. Ive read countless articles both here and on other websites and I cant seem to find the right code to use. Most sites have rows with multiple check boxes or a different layout of their table. </p> <p>I posted here to hopefully be pointed in some direction as to how to update the DB with these values of the check marks.</p>

9950737	1	How to avoid circular dependencies when setting Properties? <p>This is a design principle question for classes dealing with mathematical/physical equations where the user is allowed to set any parameter upon which the remaining are being calculated. In this example I would like to be able to let the frequency be set as well while avoiding circular dependencies.</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>from traits.api import HasTraits, Float, Property from scipy.constants import c, h class Photon(HasTraits): wavelength = Float # would like to do Property, but that would be circular? frequency = Property(depends_on = 'wavelength') energy = Property(depends_on = ['wavelength, frequency']) def _get_frequency(self): return c/self.wavelength def _get_energy(self): return h*self.frequency </code></pre> <p>I'm also aware of an update trigger timing problem here, because I don't know the sequence the updates will be triggered:</p> <ol> <li>Wavelength is being changed</li> <li>That triggers an updated of both dependent entities: frequency and energy</li> <li>But energy needs frequency to be updated so that energy has the value fitting to the new wavelength!</li> </ol> <p>(The answer to be accepted should also address this potential timing problem.)</p> <p>So, what' the best design pattern to get around these inter-dependent problems? At the end I want the user to be able to update either wavelength or frequency and frequency/wavelength and energy shall be updated accordingly.</p> <p>This kind of problems of course do arise in basically all classes that try to deal with equations.</p> <p>Let the competition begin! ;)</p>

8856750	0	How do I sidestep TT_NUMBER from StreamTokenizer <p>I replaced a call to String.split() with a loop using StreamTokenizer, because my users needed quoting functionality. But now I'm having problems from numbers being converted to numbers instead of left as Strings. In my loop if I get a TT_NUMBER, I convert it back to a String with Double.toString(). But that is not working for some long serial numbers that have to get sent to me; they are being converted to exponential notation.</p> <p>I can change the way I am converting numbers back into Strings, but I would really like to just not parse numbers in the first place. I see that StreamTokenizer has a parseNumbers() method, that turns on number parsing, but there doesn't seem to be a way to turn it off. What do I have to do to create and configure a parser that is identical to the default but does not parse numbers?</p>

(for instance, a line being drawn horizontally has an oldYcor of 99, but a newYcor of 100), which completely breaks my code and produces the squares out of place.</p> <p>Another strange thing i noticed is that without converting the turtle's ycor() to an int, the print statements display some bizarre values that dont make any sense to me...</p> <p>I appreciate any help!!</p>

29248865	0	Normal.dotm alternative in Excel for referencing the same single VBA code <p>Just curiosity.</p> <p>The only way I know so far is to create an add-in with code, put it in some trusted directory and hope it opens when you need it. The drawback is that it sometimes does not open together with application (e.g. I have a custom UDF in the add-in, I use it in the worksheet and an error is what I get, because the addin hasn't started). For this I have a button on my ribbon which calls a sub in the addin which does nothing, but then the addin is activated the UDF works.</p> <p>Is there any other efficient way to reference code in another workbooks, like in Word we have normal.dotm template?</p>
19165257	0	C++ template issue to Pull Up the Builder pattern into a configuration? <p>I have an algorithm that requires a large number of parameters (i.e. configuration) as part of its constructor and also requires some clearly defined creational steps. Therefore I have created a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern" rel="nofollow">Builder Pattern</a> implementation that allows to set the needed parameters and create the intermediate and final instance e.g.</p> <pre><code>// somewhere class SomeAlgo { public: SomeAlgo(double a, double b, double c, double d, double e /* etc */); ; </code></pre> <p>Now I define the Builder to be e.g.</p> <pre><code>class SomeAlgoBuilder { public: SomeAlgo&amp; createResult() { /* TODO: */ } virtual SomeAlgoBuilder&amp; creationStep1() = 0; virtual SomeAlgoBuilder&amp; creationStep2() = 0; virtual SomeAlgoBuilder&amp; creationStep3() = 0; // example setter note the builder returns *this SomeAlgoBuilder&amp; setA(double a) { a_ = a; return *this; } SomeAlgoBuilder&amp; setB(double b) { b_ = b; return *this; } // etc }; </code></pre> <p>At this point everything looks ok but now I would like to <code>Pull Up</code> the setters of the builder into a <code>SomeAlgoConfig</code> class so that I can also cover the use-case of passing around a simple configuration instead of a convoluted long list of parameters. This simple configuration is what in Java is known as a Value Object or Bean. The new Builder would be like this:</p> <pre><code>// not "is a" config but need the implementation inheritance // &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; note the need to pass SomeAlgoBuilder as template class SomeAlgoBuilder : private SomeAlgoConfig&lt;SomeAlgoBuilder&gt; { public: SomeAlgo&amp; createResult() { /* TODO: */ } virtual SomeAlgoBuilder&amp; creationStep1() = 0; virtual SomeAlgoBuilder&amp; creationStep2() = 0; virtual SomeAlgoBuilder&amp; creationStep3() = 0; }; </code></pre> <p>Now the <code>SomeAlgoConfig</code> implementation:</p> <pre><code>template&lt;T&gt; class SomeAlgoConfig { T&amp; setA(double a) { a_ = a; return *static_cast&lt;T*&gt;(this); } T&amp; setB(double b) { b_ = b; return *static_cast&lt;T*&gt;(this); } // etc } </code></pre> <p>and the intent is to be used like this:</p> <pre><code>SomeAlgoConfig config; // &lt;&lt;&lt; here it won't compile because it misses the T parameter config.setA(a).setB(b).setC(c); </code></pre> <p>This will do the trick I guess. However, whenever I'd like to use <code>SomeAlgoConfig</code> on its own (outside the context of a Builder) e.g. to pass it as parameter I need to declare it with a template parameter which would be itself <code>SomeAlgoConfig&lt;SomeAlgoConfig&gt;</code>. How can I define it in a way that it defaults to itself as template type? e.g. doing this doesn't work: <code>template&lt;typename T = SomeAlgoConfig&gt; class SomeAlgoConfig</code> because the <code>SomeAlgoConfig</code> is not yet known at that point. </p>

8683766	0	AIR from HTML: Controlling Size of New Window <p>I'm using Dreamweaver to convert a web site into an AIR desktop app. The app searches and browses through PDF files and provides links for opening them. I am foremost a web developer, so HTML and JavaScript/jQuery is what I understand, the links are simple <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags with target set to _blank. Adding any scripting to control the size of the new AIR windows in which the PDFs open causes the links to cease working at all. All tutorials I've found on how to control the size of a new AIR window show how to do it in MXML, but Dreamweaver works with a regular XML formatted application manifest.</p> <p>So, what's the trick?</p>
35278942	0	Scraping with a multithreaded queue + urllib3 suffers a drastic slowdown <p>I am trying to scrape a huge number of URLs (approximately 3 millions) that contains JSON-formatted data in the shortest time possible. To achieve this, I have a Python code (python 3) that uses Queue, Multithreading and Urllib3. Everything works fine during the first 3 min, then the code begins to slow down, then it appears to be totally stuck. I have read everything I could find on this issue but unfortunately the solution seems to requires a knowledge which lies far beyond me.</p> <p>I tried to limit the number of threads : it did not fix anything. I also tried to limit the maxsize of my queue and to change the socket timeout but it did no help either. The distant server is not blocking me nor blacklisting me, as I am able to re-launch my script any time I want with good results in the beggining (the code starts to slow down at pretty random time). Besides, sometimes my internet connection seems to be cut - as I cannot surf on any website - but this specific issue does not appear every time.</p> <p>Here is my code (easy on me please, I'm a begginer):</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python import urllib3,json,csv from queue import Queue from threading import Thread csvFile = open("X.csv", 'wt',newline="") writer = csv.writer(csvFile,delimiter=";") writer.writerow(('A','B','C','D')) def do_stuff(q): http = urllib3.connectionpool.connection_from_url('http://www.XXYX.com/',maxsize=30,timeout=20,block=True) while True: try: url = q.get() url1 = http.request('GET',url) doc = json.loads(url1.data.decode('utf8')) writer.writerow((doc['A'],doc['B'], doc['C'],doc['D'])) except: print(url) finally: q.task_done() q = Queue(maxsize=200) num_threads = 15 for i in range(num_threads): worker = Thread(target=do_stuff, args=(q,)) worker.setDaemon(True) worker.start() for x in range(1,3000000): if x &lt; 10: url = "http://www.XXYX.com/?i=" + str(x) + "&amp;plot=short&amp;r=json" elif x &lt; 100: url = "http://www.XXYX.com/?i=tt00000" + str(x) + "&amp;plot=short&amp;r=json" elif x &lt; 1000: url = "http://www.XXYX.com/?i=0" + str(x) + "&amp;plot=short&amp;r=json" elif x &lt; 10000: url = "http://www.XXYX.com/?i=00" + str(x) + "&amp;plot=short&amp;r=json" elif x &lt; 100000: url = "http://www.XXYX.com/?i=000" + str(x) + "&amp;plot=short&amp;r=json" elif x &lt; 1000000: url = "http://www.XXYX.com/?i=0000" + str(x) + "&amp;plot=short&amp;r=json" else: url = "http://www.XXYX.com/?i=00000" + str(x) + "&amp;plot=short&amp;r=json" q.put(url) q.join() csvFile.close() print("done") </code></pre>

5587261	0	Getting my Unit of Work to... well, work! <p>I am implementing Unit of Work. This is part of my interface:</p> <pre><code>public interface IUnitOfWork { void Add(object entity); void Update(object entity); void Delete(object entity); void Commit(); } </code></pre> <p>It looks like from examples I've found online or in books, the Unit of Work is forced to work with type "object", as we can be adding any "type" of entity to the uow.</p> <p>Not a big deal until it comes time to Commit(). When I commit, given an entity type, I need to look-up the repository based on the entity type, and then call the appropriate action.</p> <p>For example, I have an entity type named Expert</p> <pre><code>public class Expert { public object ID { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } } </code></pre> <p>Expert has a repository named ExpertRepository. All Repositories in my application implement IRepository:</p> <pre><code>public interface IRepository&lt;T&gt; { void Create(T item); void Update(T item); void Delete(T item); } public class ExpertRepository : IRepository&lt;Expert&gt; { public void Create(Expert item) { //TSQL to insert } public void Update(Expert item) { //TSQL to update } public void Delete(Expert item) { //TSQL to delete } } </code></pre> <p>I want to clarify that it is not the responsibility of my Repositories to add, update, or delete an entity from my uow, rather, I'll have the consuming code (maybe in a Service Layer) new up the uow, and then add directly to it... when my app is ready, it will call Commit().</p> <p>This does two things. It allows my consuming code to decide how it wants the entity to be persisted. Either the consuming code can call .Create() directly on the Repository to persist the entity with no uow, or the consuming code can start a uow, call .Add() on the uow, and then when .Commit() is called, the uow will go through all entities, and by action type (add, update delete), new up the appropriate repository, and the TSQL code will execute.</p> <p>Now, the problem I'm running into is when I'm looping through the Add, Update, and Delete collections in my uow. Here is a code snippet:</p> <pre><code>public void Commit() { using (TransactionScope tx = new TransactionScope()) { try { foreach (object item in addedItems) { if (item.GetType() == typeof(Expert)) { IRepository&lt;Expert&gt; repository = new ExpertRepository(); repository.Create((Expert)item); } } } } } </code></pre> <p>I have to resolve entity type of what's in the object collection via the item variable. Then I need to new up that entity's Repository (also providing the correct type to the IRepository interface), and then call .Create().</p> <p>That's all well and good, but I don't want to have these conditional checks for every possible entity, for the entity's interface, and the entity's repository sitting in my uow. That's very very bad.</p> <p>I know that an IoC container could help here (such as Unity), but is there any IoC container that can resolve generic types at runtime? I ask, b/c IRepository will need to be typed correctly to be a var that holds the instance of a given entity's repository.</p> <p>I've made some design decisions here such as putting the strong typing with the Repositories, not the UOW. For instance, I don't want a .Create() method sitting on a Repository that takes type object, esp. since my Repositories have a one-to-one relationship with my entities (Expert, ExpertRepository).</p> <p>I've also decided that since most of the repository calls are the same, I don't want an interface for each repository (aka, ExpertRepository implements IExpertRepository). That doesn't make sense, I think using generics here is the answer.</p> <p>But it all comes down to the problem in my uow. How do I get what I need to implement it correctly.</p> <p>Any suggestions or pointers in the right direction would be appreciated.</p> <p>Thanks!</p>

If so can you please provide a complete working reference including history, transitions, params, and so on?</p> <p>Not sure how we ended up with 10 or more solutions to something that should be a core need for any real application, but the sheer number and constant flux (no pun intended) of the solutions out there make it seems like a nearly impossible task to zero in on anything in any timely manner.

15939159	0	Mixed Content Warning for Forum Design <p>I'm currently designing a social network on my local host, that also has a forum aspect involved. There are three things that a user can do on the site that is causing me some concern. </p> <ol> <li>Log in to their profile via the header from any page on the site.</li> <li>Post things on their wall that include links to external sites.</li> <li>Post in the forum a variety of different things including links to external sites, and images on external sites.</li> </ol> <p>Because of #1 I made the entire site https. So no matter where a user was on the site, they could log in and their entire session would be encrypted. This functionality is working great but I am afraid of <code>Mixed Content Warnings</code>.</p> <p>Right now I'm thinking twice about making the full site secure b/c if I keep it this way will mixed content warnings appear for every page that has a link to an external site, or an image from an external site? Unfortunately I have never seen this warning b/c none of the browsers I use seem to show it to me. And I searched for some kind of list of browsers that show this warning but there is no finite list that I can find. So this is awkward b/c I'm worrying and trying to avoid a thing that I've never seen. But I have thought of one solution.</p> <p>My current idea on how to fix the image problem is to take images from users when they post a forum and write them to my disk, and provide the new image link. I am pretty sure this is exactly how google images stays https while showing millions of images from http sites. I think they write them all to their own server. Example: </p> <p><a href="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTj_52I-TSX79mQFJRLTDNGahtGbsh_BpYDp0H3hbzJDWK2qxPZ" rel="nofollow">https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTj_52I-TSX79mQFJRLTDNGahtGbsh_BpYDp0H3hbzJDWK2qxPZ</a></p> <p>So I think I have found a solution to the image problem but what about external links? Because when a user posts a link on their wall to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</a> for example I read the post and surround it with an anchor tag so technically to a browser wouldn't that be none secure content? Wouldn't that throw a warning? </p> <p>How could I fix this and not annoy my users? And do you have a better solution to my image problem? Thank you all for reading through my confusion.</p>

27316625	0	Loop through element of a defined size in Jquery? <p>I'm creating an animation for my website where I got different divs containing an image and an aside where I put my text describing something related to the image. The aside is a little bit wider than my picture and what happens is that when I hover it, it slides to the right and has his width increased. </p> <p>When I hover another one the first one goes back to its initial position. So I found a solution that obliged me to naturally loop through all the divs that are not hovered, but the problem now is since every divs (including the one hovered last) is not hovered, they all get the animation (thus creating a visual bug because the aside is placed absolute and behind the image) while i'd like it to be only on the first one. </p> <p>So I thought I should loop through all the divs that are not hovered AND got a defined sized (the one they got after they are behind shown), but I couldnt get it work, neither did I find a solution to loop through elements with the each function... </p> <p>Here is my HTML code : </p> <pre><code> &lt;div class="partenaires-wrapper"&gt; &lt;img src="http://mylor.fr/mauro/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sharks.png" alt="" width="223" height="138" /&gt; &lt;div class="partenaires-aside"&gt; Sed rutrum elementum odio, ut efficitur magna efficitur sit amet.

I have a certificate installed that has a private key, exportable, and I want to programmatically export it with the public key ONLY. In other words, I want a result equivalent to selecting "Do not export the private key" when exporting through certmgr and exporting to .CER.</p> <p>It seems that all of the X509Certificate2.Export methods will export the private key if it exists, as PKCS #12, which is the opposite of what I want.</p> <p>Is there any way using C# to accomplish this, or do I need to start digging into CAPICOM?</p> <p>Thanks,</p> <p>Aaron</p>

35731063	1	Compare two columns of two different dataframes <p>Recently, I switched from matlab to python with pandas. It has been working great, but i am stuck at solving the following problem efficiently. For my analysis, I have to dataframes that look somewhat like this:</p> <pre><code>dfA = NUM In Date 0 2345 we 1 01/03/16 1 3631 we 1 23/02/16 2 2564 we 1 12/02/16 3 8785 sz 2 01/03/16 4 4767 dt 6 01/03/16 5 3452 dt 7 23/02/16 6 2134 sz 2 01/03/16 7 3465 sz 2 01/03/16 </code></pre> <p>and</p> <pre><code>dfB In Count_Num 0 we 1 3 1 sz 2 2 2 dt 6 3 3 dt 7 1 </code></pre> <p>What I would like to perform is a an operation that sums all 'Num' for all "In" in dfA and compares it with the "Count_num" in dfB. Afterwards, I would like to add an column to dfB to return if the comparison is True or False. In the example above, the operation should return this:</p> <pre><code>dfB In Count_Num Check 0 we 1 3 True 1 sz 2 2 False 2 dt 6 1 True 3 dt 7 1 True </code></pre> <p>My approach:</p> <p>With value_counts() and pd.DataFrame, I constructed the following dfC from dfA dfC =</p> <pre><code> In_Number In_Total 0 we 1 4 1 sz 2 3 2 dt 6 1 3 dt 7 1 </code></pre> <p>Then I merged it with dfB to check it afterwards if the values are the same by comparing the columns within dfB. In this case, I have to end dropping the columns. Is there a better/faster way to do this? I think there is a way to do this very efficiently with one of pandas great functions. I've tried to look into <code>lookup</code> and <code>map</code>, but I can not make it work.</p> <p>Thanks for the help!</p>

1071106	0	Do web apps encrypt passwords during login when integrated security is enabled within IIS? <p>I have always enabled integrated security on my web apps inside IIS with the assumption that the passwords that are requested on the client end will always be transmitted securely (encrypted) to my authentication server (AD/LSA). Am I correct on my assumption? The reason I have always assumed this is 'coz I always think of them as being very similar to authenticating a windows client with an AD in which case the client &amp; server will either employ NTLM or Kerberos for authentication where the passwords are always encrypted.</p>

I asked around. People say that site loading performance could caused the issue.</p> <p>I've looked at the performance. Site is loading in 1 or 2 seconds if no external links such as Google ads or share button. I cannot improve the Google Ads.</p> <p>For the share button, if you view the site <strong>Multiple Share buttons</strong> are loaded and it takes long time to load all of them. But, <strong>All of them are loaded in iframe</strong> (iframe page to different page but in same domain) to avoid slowing down page load.</p> <p>I think users are OK with this because all pages are loaded fast except the share buttons which come from each service site.</p> <p>But, my concern is that if <strong>Google care about all site loading including those in iframe</strong>, then it's big problem since it takes 10 seconds. If not, I will keep those share buttons.</p> <p><strong>Should I keep the share buttons or need to get rid of those?</strong> (I used addthis, it's super slow. And I added each buttons myself)</p>

Here is my code:</p> <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; $(function () { var gridDataUrl = '@Url.Action("JsonCategories", "AdminNomCategory")' var grid = $("#reportsGrid").jqGrid({ url: gridDataUrl, datatype: "json", mtype: 'POST', colNames: [ '@Html.DisplayNameFor(model =&gt; model.CategoryGuid)', '@Html.DisplayNameFor(model =&gt; model.CategoryName)', '@Html.DisplayNameFor(model =&gt; model.CategoryDescription)' ], colModel: [ { name: 'CategoryGuid', index: 'CategoryGuid', width: 10, align: 'left', classes: "nts-grid-cell", hidden: true }, { name: 'CategoryName', index: 'CategoryName', width: 10, align: 'left', classes: "nts-grid-cell" }, { name: 'CategoryDescription', index: 'CategoryDescription', width: 10, align: 'left', classes: "nts-grid-cell" } ], rowNum: 20, rowList: [10, 20, 30], height: 450, width: 1140, pager: '#pager', /*jQuery('#pager'),*/ sortname: 'CategoryGuid', toolbarfilter: true, viewrecords: true, sortorder: "asc", caption: "Categories", ondblClickRow: function (rowid) { var gsr = jQuery("#reportsGrid").jqGrid('getGridParam', 'selrow'); if (gsr) { var CategoryGuid = grid.jqGrid('getCell', gsr, 'CategoryGuid'); window.location.href = '@Url.Action("Edit", "AdminNomCategory")/' + CategoryGuid } else { alert("Please select Row"); } }, @*onSelectRow: function (rowid) { var gsr = jQuery("#reportsGrid").jqGrid('getGridParam', 'selrow'); if (gsr) { var CategoryGuid = grid.jqGrid('getCell', gsr, 'CategoryGuid'); window.location.href = '@Url.Action("Edit", "AdminNomCategory")/' + CategoryGuid } else { alert("Please select Row"); } }*@ }); //jQuery("#reportsGrid").jqGrid('navGrid', '#pager', { edit: true, add: true, del: true }); var template = "&lt;div style='margin-left:15px;'&gt;&lt;div&gt; Customer ID &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; {CustomerID} &lt;/div&gt;"; template += "&lt;div&gt; Company Name: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;{CompanyName} &lt;/div&gt;"; template += "&lt;div&gt; Phone: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;{Phone} &lt;/div&gt;"; template += "&lt;div&gt; Postal Code: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;{PostalCode} &lt;/div&gt;"; template += "&lt;div&gt; City:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; {City} &lt;/div&gt;"; template += "&lt;hr style='width:100%;'/&gt;"; template += "&lt;div&gt; {sData} {cData} &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"; $('#reportsGrid').navGrid('#pager', // the buttons to appear on the toolbar of the grid { edit: true, add: true, del: true, search: false, refresh: false, view: false, position: "left", cloneToTop: false }, //// options for the Edit Dialog { editCaption: "The Edit Dialog", template: template, errorTextFormat: function (data) { return 'Error: ' + data.responseText } }, // options for the Add Dialog { template: template, errorTextFormat: function (data) { return 'Error: ' + data.responseText } }, // options for the Delete Dailog { errorTextFormat: function (data) { return 'Error: ' + data.responseText } } ); grid.jqGrid('filterToolbar', { searchOnEnter: true, enableClear: false }); jQuery("#pager .ui-pg-selbox").closest("td").before("&lt;td dir='ltr'&gt;Rows per page &lt;/td&gt;"); grid.jqGrid('setGridHeight', $(window).innerHeight() - 450); }); $(window).resize(function () { $('#reportsGrid').jqGrid('setGridHeight', $(window).innerHeight() - 450); }); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre> <p>I am using jqGrid 4.4.4 and ASP.NET. The thing I noticed, is that on the example page, the buttons are located inside a div with an id like 'jqGridPagerLeft', but on my page, that div has no id. So I went looking inside the jqGrid source but I'm lost and I can't figure out why it doesn't have an id allocated.</p> <p>Any clues? I just want to add the buttons to the bottom toolbar. Thx!</p>

33938334	0	Weird SQL Server stored procedure behaviour - different results between asp.net and Management Studio <p>We have a stored procedure that’s used to populate a SSRS Report. It’s a bit of a monster – loads of conditional logic (in case statements), casts (sometimes embedded in other casts) from varchar to datetime, and 3 fields that rely on calls to a function that contains some date functions . The report contains financial information for a list of contracts for one organisation.</p> <p>I need to create an asp.net page that shows a subset of the data for one organisation/contract so I cloned the sproc and added a contract parameter. However I noticed the figures for the 3 fields that rely on the function are different on the web page from when the stored procedure is run directly on the database or through the report.</p> <p>To troubleshoot I created a page (quick and dirty using <code>SqlDataSource</code> and <code>DataGrid</code>) that shows the results of the original stored procedure showing all contracts. The query runs fine through Enterprise Manager but the web page crashes with the YSOD and the message </p> <blockquote> <p>The conversion of a nvarchar data type to a datetime data type resulted in an out-of-range value.</p> </blockquote> <p>I even tried hardcoding the SQL from the stored procedure into the web page but still get the same results</p> <p>On my dev machine the original stored procedure runs and my new stored procedure does return consistent results regardless of whether viewed through the web page or Management Studio. The regional settings etc are same on the dev server and live server. The only different thing I can think of is that the live web server and db server are on separate machines.</p> <p>Has anyone come across anything like this before??</p> <p>Thanks</p>

31325860	1	Dynamic Datasets and SQLAlchemy <p>I am refactoring some old SQLite3 SQL statements in Python into SQLAlchemy. In our framework, we have the following SQL statements that takes in a dict with certain known keys and potentially any number of unexpected keys and values (depending what information was provided). </p> <pre><code>import sqlite3 import sys def dict_factory(cursor, row): d = {} for idx, col in enumerate(cursor.description): d[col[0]] = row[idx] return d def Create_DB(db): # Delete the database from os import remove remove(db) # Recreate it and format it as needed with sqlite3.connect(db) as conn: conn.row_factory = dict_factory conn.text_factory = str cursor = conn.cursor() cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE [Listings] ([ID] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL UNIQUE, [timestamp] REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT(( datetime ( 'now' , 'localtime' ) )), [make] VARCHAR, [model] VARCHAR, [year] INTEGER);") def Add_Record(db, data): with sqlite3.connect(db) as conn: conn.row_factory = dict_factory conn.text_factory = str cursor = conn.cursor() #get column names already in table cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM 'Listings'") col_names = list(map(lambda x: x[0], cursor.description)) #check if column doesn't exist in table, then add it for i in data.keys(): if i not in col_names: cursor.execute("ALTER TABLE 'Listings' ADD COLUMN '{col}' {type}".format(col=i, type='INT' if type(data[i]) is int else 'VARCHAR')) #Insert record into table cursor.execute("INSERT INTO Listings({cols}) VALUES({vals});".format(cols = str(data.keys()).strip('[]'), vals=str([data[i] for i in data]).strip('[]') )) #Database filename db = 'test.db' Create_DB(db) data = {'make': 'Chevy', 'model' : 'Corvette', 'year' : 1964, 'price' : 50000, 'color' : 'blue', 'doors' : 2} Add_Record(db, data) data = {'make': 'Chevy', 'model' : 'Camaro', 'year' : 1967, 'price' : 62500, 'condition' : 'excellent'} Add_Record(db, data) </code></pre> <p>This level of dynamicism is necessary because there's no way we can know what additional information will be provided, but, regardless, it's important that we store all information provided to us. This has never been a problem because in our framework, as we've never expected an unwieldy number of columns in our tables.</p> <p>While the above code works, it's obvious that it's not a clean implementation and thus why I'm trying to refactor it into SQLAlchemy's cleaner, more robust ORM paradigm. I started going through SQLAlchemy's official tutorials and various examples and have arrived at the following code:</p> <pre><code>from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Integer from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base from sqlalchemy import create_engine from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker Base = declarative_base() class Listing(Base): __tablename__ = 'Listings' id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) make = Column(String) model = Column(String) year = Column(Integer) engine = create_engine('sqlite:///') session = sessionmaker() session.configure(bind=engine) Base.metadata.create_all(engine) data = {'make':'Chevy', 'model' : 'Corvette', 'year' : 1964} record = Listing(**data) s = session() s.add(record) s.commit() s.close() </code></pre> <p>and it works beautifully with that data dict. Now, when I add a new keyword, such as</p> <pre><code>data = {'make':'Chevy', 'model' : 'Corvette', 'year' : 1964, 'price' : 50000} </code></pre> <p>I get a <code>TypeError: 'price' is an invalid keyword argument for Listing</code> error. To try and solve the issue, I modified the class to be dynamic, too:</p> <pre><code>class Listing(Base): __tablename__ = 'Listings' id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) make = Column(String) model = Column(String) year = Column(Integer) def __checker__(self, data): for i in data.keys(): if i not in [a for a in dir(self) if not a.startswith('__')]: if type(i) is int: setattr(self, i, Column(Integer)) else: setattr(self, i, Column(String)) else: self[i] = data[i] </code></pre> <p>But I quickly realized this would not work at all for several reasons, e.g. the class was already initialized, the data dict cannot be fed into the class without reinitializing it, it's a hack more than anything, et al.). The more I think about it, the less obvious the solution using SQLAlchemy seems to me. So, my main question is, <strong>how do I implement this level of dynamicism using SQLAlchemy?</strong></p> <p>I've researched a bit to see if anyone has a similar issue. The closest I've found was <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2768607/dynamic-class-creation-in-sqlalchemy">Dynamic Class Creation in SQLAlchemy</a> but it only talks about the constant attributes ("<strong>tablename</strong>" et al.). I believe the unanswered <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29105206/sqlalchemy-dynamic-attribute-change">SQLalchemy dynamic attribute change</a> may be asking the same question. While Python is not my forte, I consider myself a highly skilled programmer (C++ and JavaScript are my strongest languages) in the context scientific/engineering applications, so I may not hitting the correct Python-specific keywords in my searches.</p> <p>I welcome any and all help.</p>

12458198	1	merging selenium rc and webdriver <p>I have made most of my automation code using Selenium RC with Python. But, I feel that with the evolution in my product (what I'm testing through selenium RC), my automation needs are changed. I tried Wedriver with python and it works a treat with my product. But, as many features of my new product versions are inherited from the previous versions, I feel that I can make use of my existing Selenium RC code. But, for new features, I want to use Webdriver.</p> <p>Moreover, there are also some things w.r.t the selenium profile that I 'm maintaining. Examples:</p> <ol> <li>For ssl certificates, using selenium RC, I have 2 methods: Selenium profile (where I have saved the acceptance of ssl certificate) and <code>'trustallsslcertificates'</code> parameter while starting selenium rc. Using <code>trustallsslcertificates</code> slows down the automation speed like hell.<br> But, using webdriver, I dont need all such ssl certificates.</li> <li>Using Selenium RC, whenever I need to download a file using my web page, I have used the save option as default and saved it in the same selenium profile. But, using webdriver, I have other options to download a file, rather than maintaining the selenium profile.</li> </ol> <p>I also checked in the existing question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4342088/selenium-web-driver-and-selenium-rc">Selenium Web driver and selenium RC</a>, but, the answer seems to old, many things must have updated by then. </p> <p>Crux of my question is: Can I integrate my existing python code, that I use using selenium RC (Python bindings - selenium.py ), with Webdriver using python ?</p> <p>PS: Currently I am using selenium 2.3.0.jar file</p>

24278474	0	containsKey check for hashmap <p>I have read multiple posts to understand this, but I can't seem to quite get in on why we do a check if a map does not contain a key before performing a put operation? For eg,</p> <pre><code> if(!myMap.containsKey(myKey) { myMap.put(myKey,myValue); } </code></pre> <p>Why do we need this check? Either way, map doesn't allow duplicate key, and replaces the key with the new value if the key already exists. So why do we need to check this explicitly? Is this check needed for all implementations of Map? I am sorry if this is a very basic question. I can't seem to find an answer to this exact question. If there are posts that answer this that I may have missed, please point me to them, and feel free to mark mine as duplicate.</p>

31955993	0	When cant a object be added to an object <p>Trying to add a value to a object. The object was generated from the start by a database request, containing a number of entires. A sample entry (say number 0) looks as follows:</p> <pre><code>{ _id: 55c8a069cca746f65c98369d, fulltext: 'Finance', alias: 'Finance', level: 0, fullurl: 'http://v-ghost.port0.org:808/dbfswiki/index.php/FMP', __v: 0, _parrent: [] } </code></pre> <p>Now I want to add an additional array to this object. An empty structure where there will be a number of other listings. I started by using <code>.push</code>, but the object does not have a <code>push</code> function. This one has done a few rounds, so latest version below:</p> <p>The structure I do want is:</p> <pre><code> { _id: 55c8a069cca746f65c98369d, fulltext: 'Finance', alias: 'Finance', level: 0, fullurl: 'http://v-ghost.port0.org:808/dbfswiki/index.php/FMP', __v: 0, _parrent: [] childs: [] } </code></pre> <p>I am not putting anything into childs at this point <em>(childs because children seems to reserved, and while it might work, don't really want to try changing it when the code is already broken)</em>, basically just adding an empty slot to put similar objects into as part of later processing. <strong>Really weird</strong> Changed the code as follows: console.log ("Root record now " + rootRecord); rootRecord.childs = 1; console.log("Alias is " + rootRecord.alias); console.log("Child is " + rootRecord.childs); console.log("The complete structure is: \n"+rootRecord)</p> <p>And I get the following output</p> <pre><code>Alias is Finance Child is 1 The complete structure is: { _id: 55c8a069cca746f65c98369d, fulltext: 'Finance', alias: 'Finance', level: 0, fullurl: 'http://v-ghost.port0.org:808/dbfswiki/index.php/FMP', __v: 0, _parrent: [] } </code></pre> <p>So I can read rootRecord.childs, but its not listed, its almost as it is a "hidden" variable somehow.</p> <p><strong>The offending code</strong></p> <pre><code> console.log("Creating root structure");

13923097	0	Android Front-Facing Camera Preview Size <p>I have an app that I am working on that makes use of the front-facing camera on the device. I am trying to set the preview size by getting the list of supported preview sizes and looping through them looking for one that is pretty close. The method that I wrote to do so is basically the same as the one from the OS's own camera app. The method works fine, exactly how I would like it to, that's not why I am here.</p> <p>I was having problems with the camera preview looking obviously skewed on some devices; either squishing or stretching the preview of the image. I couldn't figure out why it was doing this so I stepped through it and looked at all of the supported preview sizes available to my front-facing camera and found that there were only 2 and neither of them were the correct aspect to be usable. My "surfaceChanged" method in my SurfaceHolder.Callback class is reporting a width and height of 762x480 for the front-facing camera, but of the two supported preview sizes (acquired with cam.getParameters().getSupportedPreviewSizes()) both were in the opposite aspect: 480x800, 320x640. </p> <p>With these as the only options, it seems impossible to have a preview for my front-facing camera that is not skewed. I know that in versions 2.3 or less, arbitrary values can be used for width and height without regard to supported sizes, but I am trying to make my app work for newer versions of the OS as well. How can I make the preview look correct?</p>

35967181	0	Equivalent to DirectInput for Windows Store Apps? <p>I am building a game for Windows 10 that utilizes input to draw on the screen, but the fidelity is lacking. It is not accurate enough to draw a straight line if you draw fast. That's when I thought of DirectInput, which I've used in C++ games for Windows 7, but that API is not available for Store Apps... is there an equivalent, which will increase my accuracy for the drawing?</p>

How would you know what the wrapper name was in the class? Seems like you'd have to know it in advance to get the appropriate context options (unless you just assume that the first context option array is the correct one) but what if you weren't going to know it in advance?</p>
39404570	0	Understanding lexical scoping of "use open ..." of Perl <pre><code>use open qw( :encoding(UTF-8) :std ); </code></pre> <p>Above statement seems to be effective in its lexical scope only and should not affect outside of it's scope.

11371468	0	Bug using UISplitViewController in a UITabController in iPad interface <p>I am a new IOS developer working on my first app. I'm quite a way in to it, and have managed to get pretty much everything working how I want, but I'm chasing an odd bug.</p> <p>Here's the basic app design (yes, I understand it may not confirm to Apple UI guidelines) as best I can describe it:</p> <p>It's a universal app written in the latest X Code fully using storyboarding. I have a working iPhone and iPad interface, but it's in the iPad interface where my issue exists. The root controller is a UITabView. On one of the tabs, I have a split view controller which implements the typical master detail pattern. In portrait mode, the master table is hidden and content renders. A navigation bar button brings forth the master table view. You select an item and the master table view vanishes and the right side updates the content via a segue. So far so good. You rotate the device, everything keeps working. The split view master table stays on the left, and the content renders on the right. This all works great even within the tab controller.</p> <p>Here are the two use cases that demonstrate the bug not happening and happening, in that order</p> <p>1- Bug does not happen a) Launch app in Portrait. b) Select Nav button to bring up master table c) Select item from table (item renders, master table vanishes) d) Rotate device to lanscape (master/detail rotates properly) e) Pick a different view from tab controller f) Pick original view containing split view g) Everything is great</p> <p>2- Bug happens in this use case a) Launch app in Portrait b) Select Nav button to bring up master table c) Select item from table (item renders, master table vanishes) d) Pick a different view from the tab controller e) Rotate device to landscape whilst in the other tab view f) Pick original view with the split controller from the tab bar g) View comes back, detail is rendered, master/view is completely missing.</p> <p>So, it seems to be that if the master/detail rendered in landscape before the other tab view was selected, everything is fine. But if the master/detail view doesn't render in landscape at least once before you pick another view in the tab, it doesn't work right.</p> <p>In my viewWillAppear method for the master/table controller, I check self.masterPopoverController.isPopoverVisible and sure enough it returns false.</p> <p>I'm wondering if this is a bug, or maybe one of the reasons Apple doesn't recommend putting a split view in another controller?</p>

If I remove it(<code>"textBoxControl":$get("comboBox2_comboBox2_TextBox")</code>) from the snippet, it can be edited but the button behind is not working, it means the dropdown list doesn't work.</p> <p>Any ideas what's going on here? Thanks in advance.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p> <p>I figured that it's the Ajax Control Toolkit, I think that the snippet I posted is the key for this issue. When the page loads, it changes and overrides the original element. I checked the document about this control and found that the dropDownStyle is for controlling the permission to allow user to edit or not. But as the document says, there are three values which are 'DropDownList', 'DropDown' and 'Simple'. But it didn't work when I changed this value. </p>
24295090	1	Python RQ: pattern for callback <p>I have now a big number of documents to process and am using Python RQ to parallelize the task.</p> <p>I would like a pipeline of work to be done as different operations is performed on each document. For example: <code>A</code> -> <code>B</code> -> <code>C</code> means pass the document to function <code>A</code>, after <code>A</code> is done, proceed to <code>B</code> and last <code>C</code>.</p> <p>However, Python RQ does not seem to support the pipeline stuff very nicely.</p> <p>Here is a simple but somewhat dirty of doing this. In one word, each function along the pipeline call its next function in a nesting way.</p> <p>For example, for a pipeline <code>A</code>-><code>B</code>-><code>C</code>.</p> <p>At the top level, some code is written like this:</p> <p><code>q.enqueue(A, the_doc)</code></p> <p>where q is the <code>Queue</code> instance and in function <code>A</code> there are code like:</p> <p><code>q.enqueue(B, the_doc)</code></p> <p>And in <code>B</code>, there are something like this:</p> <p><code>q.enqueue(C, the_doc)</code></p> <p>Is there any other way more elegant than this? For example some code in <strong>ONE</strong> function:</p> <p><code>q.enqueue(A, the_doc) q.enqueue(B, the_doc, after = A) q.enqueue(C, the_doc, after= B) </code></p> <p><a href="http://python-rq.org/docs/" rel="nofollow">depends_on</a> parameter is the closest one to my requirement, however, running something like:</p> <p><code> A_job = q.enqueue(A, the_doc) q.enqueue(B, depends_on=A_job )</code></p> <p>won't work. As <code>q.enqueue(B, depends_on=A_job )</code> is executed immediately after <code>A_job = q.enqueue(A, the_doc)</code> is executed. By the time B is enqueued, the result from A might not be ready as it takes time to process.</p> <p>PS:</p> <p>If Python RQ is not really good at this, what else tool in Python can I use to achieve the same purpose:</p> <ol> <li>round-robin parallelization</li> <li>pipeline processing support</li> </ol>

12294423	0	BlackBerry - How do I access a database (or create HTTP connection) in a background thread when the UI Application is not open <p><strong>Overview:</strong></p> <p>Our application extends a UIApplication and has a SMS Listener class that is registered on boot. When a message is received that fits our criteria we process the message and then we want to save it to a local SQLite database as well as upload it to a Web Server. It is important that this happens as soon as possible after the SMS is received, even if the UI Application is not open at that stage.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p> <p>When the SMSListener Instance is running in the background, with no UIApplication instance active, and wants to access the SQLite database or tries to create a HTTP Connection a “No Application Instance” exception is thrown.</p> <p><strong>Desired outcome:</strong></p> <p>We want to process, save and upload all the messages from the SMSListener background thread even if the UIApplication is not active. Currently the SMSListener background thread would store the messages in the RuntimeStore; when the UI Application is started it reads the messages from the RuntimeStore and saves it to the database. This is not an optimal solution though, because the synchronisation with the Web Server would also then only happen when the UI Application is next opened. It is important that it rather syncs when the message is received.</p> <p><strong>Application Pseudo Code:</strong></p> <p>Main Class, checks for startup and creates a SMSListener instance or gets the instance from the RuntimeStore.</p> <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public class OurAppUi extends UiApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { if (args != null &amp;&amp; args.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; args[0].endsWith("gui")) { // Create a new instance of the application and make the currently // running thread the application's event dispatch thread. OurAppUi theApp = new OurAppUi(); theApp.enterEventDispatcher(); } else { // Entered through the alternate application entry point SmsListener.waitForSingleton(); } } } </code></pre> <p>The SMSListener Class listens for any incoming messages, makes use of the RuntimeStore Singleton Model. This is working as expected.</p> <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public class SmsListener implements javax.wireless.messaging.MessageListener { public static SmsListener waitForSingleton() { //Ensure this is a singleton instance. //Open RuntimeStore and obtain the reference of BackgroundListener RuntimeStore store = RuntimeStore.getRuntimeStore(); Object obj = store.get(ID_BACKGROUND_LISTENER); //If obj is null, there is no current reference to BackgroundListener //Start a new instance of BackgroundLIstener if one is not running if(obj == null) { store.put(ID_BACKGROUND_LISTENER, new SmsListener()); return (SmsListener)store.get(ID_BACKGROUND_LISTENER); } else { return(SmsListener)obj; } } public void notifyIncomingMessage(MessageConnection conn) { new Thread() { MessageConnection connection; Thread set (MessageConnection con) { this.connection = con; return (this); } public void run() { try { Message m = connection.receive(); String msg = null; if (m instanceof TextMessage) { TextMessage tm = (TextMessage)m; msg = tm.getPayloadText(); } // Process the SMS SMSObject sms = processSMS(msg); // Save to DataBase { Exception is Thrown Here } SQLManager.getInstance().save(sms); // Upload to Web Server { Exception is Thrown Here } WebServer.upload(sms); } catch(Exception error) { } } }.set(conn).start(); } } </code></pre> <p>When the SmsListener Instance wants to access the SQLite database or tries to create a HTTP Connection a “No Application Instance” exception is thrown. </p> <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public final class SQLManager { private SQLManager() { try { db = OpenOrCreateDatabase(); } catch (MalformedURIException e) { Debug.log(TAG, "Get connection: URI: " + e.getMessage()); } catch (ControlledAccessException e) { Debug.log(TAG, "Get connection: Controlled Access: " + e.getMessage()); } catch (DatabasePathException e) { Debug.log(TAG, "Get connection: Database Path: " + e.getMessage()); } catch (DatabaseIOException e) { Debug.log(TAG, "Get connection: Database IO: " + e.getMessage()); } catch (Exception e) { Debug.log(TAG, e); } } public static synchronized SQLManager getInstance() { if (instance == null) { instance = new SQLManager(); } return instance; } } </code></pre> <p>We’ve tried store the SQLite instances in the RuntimeStore, using the same Singleton Model as the SMSListener but received errors when the UI Application tried to access the stored DB Instance. </p>

12299724	0	List of Natural Language Processing Tools in Regards to Sentiment Analysis - Which one do you recommend <p>first up sorry for my not so perfect English... I am from Germany ;) </p> <p>So, for a research project of mine (Bachelor thesis) I need to analyze the sentiment of tweets about certain companies and brands. For this purpose I will need to script my own program / use some sort of modified open source code (no APIs' - I need to understand what is happening). </p> <p>Below you will find a list of some of the NLP Applications I found. My Question now is which one and which approach would you recommend? And which one does not require long nights adjusting the code?</p> <p>For example: When I screen twitter for the music player >iPod&lt; and someone writes: "It's a terrible day but at least my iPod makes me happy" or even harder: "It's a terrible day but at least my iPod makes up for it" </p> <p>Which software is smart enough to understand that the focused is on iPod and not the weather? </p> <p>Also which software is scalable / resource efficient (I want to analyze several tweets and don't want to spend thousands of dollars)? </p> <p><strong>Machine learning and data mining</strong></p> <p><em>Weka</em> - is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining. It is one of the most popular text classification frameworks. It contains implementations of a wide variety of algorithms including Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM, listed under SMO) [Note: Other commonly used non-Java SVM implementations are SVM-Light, LibSVM, and SVMTorch]. A related project is Kea (Keyphrase Extraction Algorithm) an algorithm for extracting keyphrases from text documents.</p> <p><em>Apache Lucene Mahout</em> - An incubator project to created highly scalable distributed implementations of common machine learning algorithms on top of the Hadoop map-reduce framework.</p> <p><strong>NLP Tools</strong></p> <p><em>LingPipe</em> - (not technically 'open-source, see below) Alias-I's Lingpipe is a suite of java tools for linguistic processing of text including entity extraction, speech tagging (pos) , clustering, classification, etc... It is one of the most mature and widely used open source NLP toolkits in industry. It is known for it's speed, stability, and scalability. One of its best features is the extensive collection of well-written tutorials to help you get started. They have a list of links to competition, both academic and industrial tools. Be sure to check out their blog. LingPipe is released under a royalty-free commercial license that includes the source code, but it's not technically 'open-source'.</p> <p><em>OpenNLP</em> - hosts a variety of java-based NLP tools which perform sentence detection, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, chunking and parsing, named-entity detection, and co-reference analysis using the Maxent machine learning package.</p> <p><em>Stanford Parser and Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagger</em> - Java packages for sentence parsing and part of speech tagging from the Stanford NLP group. It has implementations of probabilistic natural language parsers, both highly optimized PCFG and lexicalized dependency parsers, and a lexicalized PCFG parser. It's has a full GNU GPL license.</p> <p><em>OpenFST</em> - A package for manipulating weighted finite state automata. These are often used to represented a probablistic model. They are used to model text for speech recognition, OCR error correction, machine translation, and a variety of other tasks. The library was developed by contributors from Google Research and NYU. It is a C++ library that is meant to be fast and scalable.</p> <p><em>NTLK</em> - The natural language toolkit is a tool for teaching and researching classification, clustering, speech tagging and parsing, and more. It contains a set of tutorials and data sets for experimentation. It is written by Steven Bird, from the University of Melbourne.</p> <p><em>Opinion Finder</em> - A system that performs subjectivity analysis, automatically identifying when opinions, sentiments, speculations and other private states are present in text. Specifically, OpinionFinder aims to identify subjective sentences and to mark various aspects of the subjectivity in these sentences, including the source (holder) of the subjectivity and words that are included in phrases expressing positive or negative sentiments.</p> <p><em>Tawlk/osae</em> - A python library for sentiment classification on social text. The end-goal is to have a simple library that "just works". It should have an easy barrier to entry and be thoroughly documented. We have acheived best accuracy using stopwords filtering with tweets collected on negwords.txt and poswords.txt</p> <p><em>GATE</em> - GATE is over 15 years old and is in active use for all types of computational task involving human language. GATE excels at text analysis of all shapes and sizes. From large corporations to small startups, from €multi-million research consortia to undergraduate projects, our user community is the largest and most diverse of any system of this type, and is spread across all but one of the continents1.</p> <p><em>textir</em> - A suite of tools for text and sentiment mining.

28168529	0	LESS and CSS Imports - Going Crazy <p>I have an issue currently with my LESS and CSS where an import into Bootstrap.less is being called before an overriding file, yet the first import is overriding the CSS..</p> <p>As an example, let's say my bootstrap.less file looks like this:</p> <pre><code>/* ALL STANDARD BOOTSTRAP LESS FILE HERE*/ // Generic Widget Styles @import "components/_widget-styles.less"; // Header Area @import "components/_header-area.less"; // Global Search Spinner @import "components/_search-spinner.less"; // Smart Feed @import "components/_smart-feed.less"; // Home Page Container @import "components/_home-container.less"; // Footer @import "components/_footer.less"; // Documents Page Container @import "components/_documents.less"; </code></pre> <p>My Generic Widgets styles have some styles that can be used and overriden all over the site and in the home page container I do just that and it works fine, however for some reason I am having to use !important to override any styles which isn't really a great thing to do imo. Should it use the last style to be added to the CSS file?</p>
21268426	1	Having a try at computing the sieve of Eratosthenes <p>I'm an absolute novice to python but I am trying to compute something that should act like the sieve of Eratosthenes.</p> <p>I'm going to start easy and just create a set with all integers from 2 up to 100. Let's call that set S.</p> <p>I then want to create a set of all integers n such that 2n is contained in that set, let's call it P1. In other words, a set of the integers 2, 4, 6, 8 etc.</p> <p>I want to then do the same thing but with P2 = 3n and then P3 = 5n.</p> <p>In the end I want to return all integers of my set S but disregard the integers in P1, P2 and P3.</p> <p>How would I go on about doing this?</p> <p>My try:</p> <pre><code> numbers=set(range(2,100)) </code></pre> <p>but I'm stuck on creating the other sets and disregarding them!</p> <p>Thanks.</p> <p>My idea so far:</p> <pre><code>def sieve(n): S = set(range(2, 100)) P1 = set(range(0, 100, 2)) P2 = set(range(0, 100, 3)) P3 = set(range(0, 100, 5)) P5 = set(range(0, 100, 7)) return S-P1-P2-P3-P5 print (sieve(100)) </code></pre>

36639577	0	Paypal vs braintree for user to user payments <p>I need a solution that allows UserA to make a payment to UserB. UserA is a registered account in a web service that has their information stored in the "vault". UserB has no registered account and would simply pay at checkout by entering a valid card number. The web service would take 2% of the payment that goes to I guess a separate account for the website.</p> <p>I am trying to wrap my head around which payment service to use as this is the first time I am creating a service with money transactions involved. I like Braintree specifically from what I see:</p> <ul> <li>Free up to first 50k (good for a small cloud based web service)</li> <li>Drop in UI that handles the encryption side of thigns for me (so it seems)</li> </ul> <p>My question is my solution requirements need me to seemily split up the transaction that UserB pays from a card into two places - a portion to UserA and a portion to the web service. Does Brain tree offer a solution that makes this possible as I see it is with Paypal <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/products/adaptive-payments/" rel="nofollow">Adaptive Payments</a></p> <p>Just looking for a quick link to the documentation.</p>

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007E)</p> <p>I then had him install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8328" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8328</a></p> <p>thinking that would help. Any ideas why it is not finding the dll on his computer but finds it fine on my computer?</p> <p>EDIT: I should have noted HookHandler.dll sits in the same folder as the exe. Again, it works on my computer when I run the exe and HookHandler is there in my folder. I zip it up with HookHandler and gave it to someone else and it doesn't work and I verified HookHandler was there in his folder.</p> <p>For somereason, installing visual studio fixed the issue. so it must be something HookHandler depends on so I need to try the ProcMon tool or depends.exe to see what HookHandler is depending on I guess.</p> <p>thanks, Dean</p>

But I needed a way to have the user select this object by id using a normal UIButton so I added it as a subview and the click event works as expected.</p> <p>The issue is this - how can I pass an int value to this click event?

How do the professionals pass an int value like this?</p> <p>Also it's important that I can get the actual [x intValue] from the int later in the process. A while back I thought I could do this with a simple</p> <p>NSLog(@"the actual selected hat was %d", [obj.idValue intValue]);</p> <p>But this doesn't appear to work (any idea how I can pull the actual int value directly from the variable?).</p> <p>The working code I have is below</p> <pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { static NSString *CellIdentifier = @"Cell"; UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier]; if (cell == nil) { cell = [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier] autorelease]; } if ([self.hats count] &gt; 0) { Hat* obj = [self.hats objectAtIndex: [indexPath row]]; NSMutableString* fullName = [[NSMutableString alloc] init]; [fullName appendFormat:@"%@", obj.name]; [fullName appendFormat:@" %@", obj.type]; cell.textLabel.text = fullName; cell.accessoryType = UITableViewCellAccessoryDetailDisclosureButton; //add the button to subview hack UIButton* button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeRoundedRect]; button.frame = CGRectMake(50, 5, 50, 25); [button setTitle:@"Select" forState:UIControlStateNormal]; button.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor]; button.adjustsImageWhenHighlighted = YES; button.tag = obj.idValue; //this is my current hack to add the id but no dice :( [button addTarget:self action:@selector(action:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside]; [cell.contentView addSubview:button]; //hack } return cell; } - (void)action:(id)sender { int* hatId = ((UIButton *)sender).tag; //try to pull the id value I added above ... //do something w/ the hatId } </code></pre>

32196880	1	Copying a list of lists into part of another one in the most pythonic way <p>I have a large list of lists, for now containing only zeros.

The only way I've found so far is this:</p> <pre><code>start = (startrow, startcol) for i in range( start[0], start[0] + len(shortlist) ): for j in range( start[1], start[1] + len(shortlist[0]) ): longlist[i][j] = shortlist[i-start[0]][j-start[1]] </code></pre> <p>However, this doesn't feel very pythonic - as far as I know, list comprehensions are in general prefered to loops, and even though I didn't find it in few hours of searching, there might be some function doing this more elegantly.

23120626	0	Word VBA: How to reference a chart in a table <p>In a Word document, I have several tables into which I have placed charts within cells. Now I need to access these charts through VBA, to update data values and other properties. The logic driving the updates to the charts is linked to the table the charts are embedded in, so I need to know something about the table context when accessing the charts.</p> <p>Originally, I had planned to bookmark the tables, and then iterate through the charts associated with each table. However, I now realise that the Word "Table" object doesn't have a "Shapes", or "Inlineshapes", or "Charts" collection.</p> <p>So my question is: what is the best way to access/reference charts embedded in a table?</p>

5856918	0	Performance with WPF Combo Box inside a ListView <p>I was wondering if I was missing something obvious.</p> <p>I have a simple window with a ListView with 3 columns in it. One displays text and the other two have combo boxes in them.</p> <p>The ListView has approx. 500 records and the Comboboxes both pull from the same contact list which has approx. 8,000 records in it.</p> <p>I am using MVVM.</p> <p>This window takes for ever to open and once it does open it is practically frozen solid (it moves so slow)</p> <p>the queries to the database take under ten seconds (I log when the VM is fully loaded) then it takes two or three minutes to open the window. I made sure to store both lists in <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> in my VM to make sure its not reprocessing the data or anything like that.</p> <p>As you can see below. I've tried explicitly using Virtualizing Stack Panel but that did not help much.</p> <p>Thank you for any help</p> <pre><code> &lt;DataTemplate x:Key="ComboboxItemTemplate"&gt; &lt;Grid&gt; &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="Auto" /&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="*" /&gt; &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt; &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height="Auto" /&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height="Auto" /&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height="Auto" /&gt; &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt; &lt;Image Grid.RowSpan="3" Source="{Binding ImageURL, IsAsync=True}" Width="50" /&gt; &lt;TextBlock Grid.Column="1" Text="{Binding Name}" /&gt; &lt;TextBlock Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="1" Text="{Binding Email}" /&gt; &lt;TextBlock Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="2" Text="{Binding CampusName}" /&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt; &lt;/DataTemplate&gt; &lt;ListView ItemsSource="{Binding MainList}" IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem="True" Grid.RowSpan="2"&gt; &lt;ListView.ItemsPanel&gt; &lt;ItemsPanelTemplate&gt; &lt;VirtualizingStackPanel /&gt; &lt;/ItemsPanelTemplate&gt; &lt;/ListView.ItemsPanel&gt; &lt;ListView.View&gt; &lt;GridView&gt; &lt;GridViewColumn Width="200" Header="Internal"&gt; &lt;GridViewColumn.CellTemplate&gt; &lt;DataTemplate&gt; &lt;StackPanel&gt; &lt;TextBlock Text="{Binding Name}" FontWeight="Bold" /&gt; &lt;TextBlock Text="{Binding MName}" /&gt; &lt;TextBlock Text="{Binding CampusName}" /&gt; &lt;/StackPanel&gt; &lt;/DataTemplate&gt; &lt;/GridViewColumn.CellTemplate&gt; &lt;/GridViewColumn&gt; &lt;GridViewColumn Width="200" Header="Contact1"&gt; &lt;GridViewColumn.CellTemplate&gt; &lt;DataTemplate&gt; &lt;ComboBox ItemsSource="{Binding Source={StaticResource VM}, Path=ContactList, IsAsync=True}" SelectedValue="{Binding HisContactID}" SelectedValuePath="id" ItemTemplate="{StaticResource ComboboxItemTemplate}" Background="{Binding HisColor}" Margin="0,82,0,115" Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="1"&gt; &lt;ComboBox.ItemsPanel&gt; &lt;ItemsPanelTemplate&gt; &lt;VirtualizingStackPanel /&gt; &lt;/ItemsPanelTemplate&gt; &lt;/ComboBox.ItemsPanel&gt; &lt;/ComboBox&gt; &lt;/DataTemplate&gt; &lt;/GridViewColumn.CellTemplate&gt; &lt;/GridViewColumn&gt; &lt;GridViewColumn Width="200" Header="Contact2"&gt; ... &lt;/GridViewColumn&gt; &lt;/GridView&gt; &lt;/ListView.View&gt; &lt;/ListView&gt; </code></pre>

16743380	0	string to xmlNode delphi (or how to add an xml fragment to TXMLDocument) <p>I Have a few text strings that contain well formed XML. </p> <p>I would like to be able to (1) turn these strings into <code>IXMLNodes</code> then (2) append them to an existing <code>XMLDocument</code>. Preferably without declaring a new <code>XMLDocument</code> first. </p> <p>This doesn't seem possible? </p> <p>Is there any easy way to accomplish something equivalent though? My initial thought was to use the <code>IXMLNode.XML</code> (string) property and insert the new strings. No such luck as <code>IXMLNode.XML</code> is Read Only.</p> <p>Here is an example, if I had the following strings in a <code>TStringList</code>,</p> <pre><code>&lt;Property Name="Version" RttiType="tkString"&gt;&lt;/Property&gt; &lt;Property Name="ShowSubunit" RttiType="tkBoolean"&gt;&lt;/Property&gt; </code></pre> <p>And I had the following XML, already loaded into a <code>TXMLDocument</code>, how could I easily append the two lines above into the <code>TXMLDocument</code> below?</p> <pre><code>&lt;Program Name="PFOO"&gt; &lt;Class Name="CFOO"&gt; &lt;Property Name="DBN" RttiType="tkString"/&gt; &lt;Property Name="SDate" RttiType="tkClass" ClassType="TXSDATE"&gt;12/30/1899&lt;/Property&gt; &lt;Property Name="XForm" RttiType="tkEnumeration"&gt;xfXML&lt;/Property&gt; &lt;Property Name="Singleton" RttiType="tkBoolean"&gt;True&lt;/Property&gt; &lt;/Class&gt; &lt;/Program&gt; </code></pre> <p>Any other (simple) ways to achieve this (no protected hack on the XML property please)? </p> <p>Thank you!</p>

6050805	0	getting the raw source from Firefox with javascript <p>I am writing a program to validate web pages on a remote server. It uses selenium RC to run Firefox with a battery of tests, so I can call arbitrary javascript. When there is a failure I would like to log the page's generated HTML. Now getting access to the DOM HTML is easy, But I am having real trouble finding a way to get at the source. Thanks.</p> <p>I should reiterate that I am not looking for the DOM, but the original unmodified source code. As can be seen through Right click -> view page source. Specifically if <code>&lt;Html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; fear the table data &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/table&gt;</code></p> <p> is the real HTML. Calls to <code>document.documentElement.outerHTML || document.documentElement.innerHTML</code> and <code>selenium.getHTMLSource()</code> will result in <code>&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; fear the table data &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;/body&gt;</code></p>

The <code>$search_string</code> contains plain text + html tags + <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> elements. The problem is that only sometimes the <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> elements convert to white space on run time, making it difficult to find and replace using <code>str_replace()</code>.

33240205	1	Pass list of different named tuples to different csv by tuple name <p>I have a program in which I wish to record all major changes that occur. For example: each time a variable x changes in value record the time of the change and the change itself. Within the program there are many such changes and not all have the same number of parameters. </p> <p>I decided to use namedtuples to store each instance of a change and to then put those namedtuples into a single master data list -ready for export to csv. I have used tuples as of course they are immutable which is ideal for record keeping. Below I have tried to explain in as concise a manner as possible what I have done and tried. Hopefully my problem and attempts so far are clear.</p> <p>So I have:</p> <pre><code>data = [] </code></pre> <p>as the main repository, with namedtuples of the form:</p> <pre><code>a_tuple = namedtuple('x_change', ['Time', 'Change']) another_tuple = namedtuple('y_change', ['Time', 'Change', 'id']) </code></pre> <p>I can then append instances of these namedtuples each time a change is detected to data using commands as below:</p> <pre><code>data.append(a_tuple(a_time, a_change)) data.append(another_tuple(a_time, a_change, an_id)) </code></pre> <p>If I then print out the contents of data I would get output like:</p> <pre><code>x_change(a_time=4, a_change=1) y_change(a_time=5, a_change=3, an_id = 2) y_change(a_time=7, a_change=1, an_id = 3) x_change(a_time=8, a_change=3) </code></pre> <p>what I would like to do is export these tuples to csv files by tuple name. So in the above case I would end up with two csv files of the form:</p> <pre><code>name, time, change x_change, 4, 1 x_change, 8, 3 </code></pre> <p>and;</p> <pre><code>name, time, change, id y_change, 5, 3, 2 y_change, 7, 1, 3 </code></pre> <p>I have to date managed to write to a single csv as below:</p> <pre><code>with open ('events.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile: output = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter = ',') for row in data: output.writerow(row) </code></pre> <p>which produces the output minus the tuple name. So:</p> <pre><code>4, 1 5, 3, 2 7, 1, 3 8, 3 </code></pre> <p>I have also tried:</p> <pre><code>with open ('events.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile: output = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter = ',') for row in data: output.writerow(str(row)) </code></pre> <p>Which splits the file into csv format, including the tuple name, by every character getting (first line only included): </p> <pre><code>x, _, c, h, a, n, g, e, 4, 1 </code></pre> <p>I have searched for a solution but not come across anything that fits what I am trying to do and am now at a loss. Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>

37380984	0	Firebase Facebook Login from Ionic (Cordova) app in iOS Emulator <p>I'm configuring my Ionic app to work with Facebook Authentication. Everything seems about right when I debug the app from my browser; however, when I deploy the app to the iOS emulator I get the following message in the safari console:</p> <p>"This domain is not authorized for OAuth operations for your Firebase project. Edit the list of authorized domains from the Firebase console."</p> <p>I suppose that makes sense. I went over to the Firebase console to add an additional domain name which my emulator was running on, but have no idea what the domain would be. I even tried logging "window.location.hostname" but it came up as completely blank when I run the app from the emulator (it's localhost when I run it from the browser). Any idea how to allow the emulator to utilize Firebase authentication? Thanks a bunch. Please let me know if I can provide additional details.</p>

28490593	0	Error on using Vim-latex ("can't find file ~") <p>I'm not sure if this question is appropriate here but I have nowhere else to ask. I recently started to typeset some 'mathsy' stuff using Latex and it became a hobby for me. I've been using TeXnicCenter for this, but feeling that I've got familiar with Latex language, I decieded to improve 'efficiency' of typesetting by changing the editor.</p> <p>So I decided to use <strong>Vim</strong> (latest version, 7.4) with Suite-Latex. I've just installed Vim and Suite-Latex, following exactly what was instructed <a href="http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/index.php?subject=download&amp;title=Download" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I made every necessary changes mentioned <a href="http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/documentation/latex-suite/recommended-settings.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and it seemed to me that installation was successful (I got what was expected on Step 4)</p> <p>Then I started to work through <a href="http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/documentation/latex-suite-quickstart/lsq-using-tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a> and everything went fine until <a href="http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/documentation/latex-suite-quickstart/lsq-inserting-reference.html" rel="nofollow">this section</a>.</p> <p>When I press F9 for autoreference, I see that Vim is working on something for split seconds and red error message refering to "can't find [some file name]" in my user/appdata/local/temp directory. The "file name" changes every time I do this (so its kind of temporary file as its directory suggests?). And then it produces a new window with title <strong>__ OUTLINE __</strong> where 2 empty lines are showing up.</p> <p>If I press n (in the new window described above) error message saying <strong>"E486: Pattern not found: rf"</strong> pops up and pressing j results in going down one row. If I press enter key, message <strong>":call Tex_FinishOutlineCompletion()"</strong> pops up.</p> <p>More frustratingly, if I try to compile a file by entering command \ll, a new window pops up where there are two lines saying:</p> <p>1.ll I can't find file `newfile.tex'. newfile.tex</p> <p>2.ll Emergency stop</p> <p>and below these is a message saying </p> <p><strong>[Quickfix list]: latex -interaction=nonstopmode -file-line-error-style newfile.tex</strong></p> <p>So I thought it maybe is something to do with VIM not being able to find files in my computer (so something wrong with grep?), and I tried to resolve it by downloading a software called "cygwin" on which developers said their tests were successful, but it changed nothing.</p> <p>But I think the two problems are related.</p> <p>As it is, I am completely newbie in this type of editing environment (or any kind of programming) but I really would like to learn some Vim seeing how efficient it is in typesetting etc. Sorry for not being a pro at typing codes here. Thanks for reading!</p>

40169813	0	How can I pass a string from a C# DLL into an unmanaged language (e.g. C++)? <p>I've had quite a lot of luck interoperating between Fortran (don't ask! :-) and C# using Robert Giesecke's wonderful "<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/robertgiesecke/Home/uploads/unmanagedexports" rel="nofollow">Unmanaged Exports</a>" library. However, one of the things I haven't been able to achieve yet is sending a string from C# to Fortran. The worst of it is that I get no indication of what's wrong. My Fortran application just crashes. I've posted this problem to the most popular Fortran forum I know (<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/comment/1888588" rel="nofollow">here</a>), and so far it has generated a lot of discussion but I'm no closer to solving the problem. I'm thinking now that if I can solve it in C/C++, perhaps I can take that solution over to Fortran more easily.</p> <p>From all the research I've done, it would seem to me that something like the following should work:</p> <pre><code>using RGiesecke.DllExport; using System.Runtime.InteropServices; namespace CSharpDll { public class Structures { [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)] public struct MyStruct { [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPStr)] public string Title; public int SourceNode; public int EndNode; } [DllExport("GetStruct", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)] public static MyStruct GetStruct() { var result = new MyStruct(); result.Title = "This is the title"; result.SourceNode = 123; result.EndNode = 321; return result; } } } </code></pre> <p>Unfortunately, my C/C++ is even rustier than my Fortan. I have no idea how to make this work on that side. Can someone help me write an extremely simple console app in C/C++ that will call the above "GetStruct" method and get the structure including the string?</p> <p>Note 1: I've tried pretty much every permutation of "UnmanagedType" as well as both "string" and "char[]" with no luck, so whereas I may not have that right in this example, please don't suggest one of those unless you can show that it works. :-)</p> <p>Note 2: The vast majority of threads I've found around this topic send strings the other way (i.e. from an unmanaged DLL to a managed application rather than from an unmanaged application to a managed DLL). I'm not interested in those, since I have that working like a charm. :-)</p>

38962095	0	Image in ListView that goes off-screen loses its state (never set to 'loaded') <p><strong>The situation:</strong> </p> <p>I have a large list of photos and we are loading them in a grid of thumbnails. These thumbnails are each their own component that are loaded in sets of three within the RenderRow function. Here's the Image component in question:</p> <pre><code>&lt;Image style={styles.image} source={this.state.loaded ? { uri: image.url_small } : imagePlaceholder} onLoad={() =&gt; { this.setState({ loaded: true }); }} onLoadStart={() =&gt; { this.setState({ loaded: false }); }} /&gt; </code></pre> <p><strong>The issue:</strong></p> <p>Our issue is that if you are scrolling rapidly, or have a less-than-optimal internet connection, some of the images that begin loading never have the "onLoad" called, presumably because they are no longer visible (because we scrolled beyond them in the list already). </p> <p>However, when we scroll back to those images, all that is rendered is the placeholder image, and the state of the photo is never set to <code>loaded: true</code>. I've tried messing with the <code>onChangeVisibleRows</code> function on the ListView like so:</p> <pre><code>onChangeVisibleRows={(visibleRows) =&gt; { const visibleRowNumbers = []; for (const row in visibleRows) { visibleRowNumbers.push(row); } this.setState({ visibleRowNumbers }); }} </code></pre> <p>This seems to work as expected and in the RenderRow function I can check if that specific row is visible, and try to re-render and images in that row by passing a <code>isVisible</code> prop to the image component, but the image component still isn't updating when I return true from <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> when the isVisible prop changes. </p> <p>But to no avail. </p> <p>I believe I'm on the right track, but have hit a dead end. <strong>Does anyone have an idea how I can force an image component to reload?</strong> Or is there some sort of <code>onLoadInterrupted</code> that might be added so that it begins loading again once it is in view?</p>

104890	0	Dealing with the rate of change in software development <p>I am primarily a .NET developer, and in that sphere alone there are at any given time probably close to a dozen fascinating emerging technologies, some of them real game-changers, that I would love to delve into. </p> <p>Sadly, this appears to be beyond the limits of human capacity. </p> <p>I read an article by Rocky Lhotka (.NET legend, inventor of CSLA, etc) where he mentioned, almost in passing, that last year he felt very terribly overwheled by the rate of change. He made it sound like maybe it wasn't possible to stay on the bleeding edge anymore, that maybe he wasn't going to try so hard because it was futile. </p> <p>It was a surprise to me that true geniuses like Lhotka (who are probably expected to devote a great deal of their time to playing with the latest technology and should be able to pick things up quickly) also feel the burn!</p> <p>So, how do you guys deal with this? Do you just chalk it up to the fact that development is vast, and it's more important to be able to find things quickly than to learn it all? Or do you have a continuing education strategy that actually allows you to stay close to the cutting edge?</p>

Any idea why is it happening? Im checking which parametter was posted with</p> <blockquote> <p>String param1 = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().getRequestParameterMap().get("param1");</p> </blockquote> <p>Another thing, when clicked on UIMenuItem in any submenu there are actually TWO calls of menuGroupAction, one with param of Top menu and another with correct param of menuItem.

So for e.g. the obiquitous factorial</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; template&lt;int N&gt; struct fact { enum { value = N * fact&lt;N-1&gt;::value }; }; template&lt;&gt; struct fact&lt;1&gt; { enum { value = 1 }; }; int main() { const int x = fact&lt;3&gt;::value; std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; "\n"; return 0; } </code></pre> <p>I would like to get back the number 3 (since fact&lt;3>, fact&lt;2>, and fact&lt;1> are instantiated). This example if of course trivial, but whenever you start using e.g. Boost.MPL, compile times really explode, and I'd like to know how much of that is due to hidden class instantiations. My question is primarily for Visual C++, but answers for gcc would also be appreciated.</p> <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: my current very brittle approach for Visual C++ is adding the compile switch from one of Stephan T. Lavavej's <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Stephan-T-Lavavej-Advanced-STL/C9-Lectures-Stephan-T-Lavavej-Advanced-STL-3-of-n">videos</a> /d1reportAllClassLayout and doing a grep + word count on the output file, but it (a) increases compile times enormously and (b) the regex is hard to get 100% correct.</p>
33297763	0	Force connection reestablishment from client app to GCM <p>We are using GCM for messaging from server to the client app. It is a standard implementation where installation of the client app talks to the gcm server to get the reg id, sends it to our server and our server uses that reg id to push messages to the app. Our requirement is that these push notifications should be instantaneous and as real time as possible.</p> <p>But the connection between GCM and the client app seems to disappear after a few minutes of inactivity. We have tried several things on our end: 1. Using an alarm manager to keep running a heartbeat intent that sends heartbeats to gcm. This does not work on custom android OSes where cleaning memory forces close of all app alarms. 2. Sending an upstream message from client to gcm in the hope that it establishes connection. 3. Using high priority messages from server to gcm hoping that would force a connection between gcm and app.</p> <p>None of it has worked so far. Any idea if there's an API in the play services framework on the client side to force establish a connection to gcm if the app determines there is no current connection based on not getting an ACK for an upstream message?</p> <p>Some research we did: 1. <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/nexus/fslYqYrULto/lU2D3Qe1mugJ" rel="nofollow">https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/nexus/fslYqYrULto/lU2D3Qe1mugJ</a></p> <ol start="2"> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18250188/do-gcm-ccs-upstream-messages-force-a-re-connection-to-the-gcm-network">Do GCM CCS Upstream Messages force a re-connection to the GCM network?</a></li> </ol>

However if I negate the filter condition, I get zero results back: </p> <pre><code>options.predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"(mediaSubtype &amp; %d) == 0", PHAssetMediaSubtypeVideoHighFrameRate]; &lt;PHFetchResult: 0x1702a6660&gt; count=0 </code></pre> <p>Confusingly, the Apple docs list the name of the field as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Photos/Reference/PHAsset_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/PHAsset/mediaSubtypes"><code>mediaSubtypes</code></a> (with an "s"), while their sample predicate is filtering on <code>mediaSubtype</code> (without an "s"). </p> <p>Trying to filter on <code>mediaSubtypes</code> produces an error:</p> <pre><code>*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: 'Can't do bit operators on non-numbers' </code></pre> <p>Has anyone been able to make heads or tails of this predicate? </p>

What I would like to do is a simple step interpolation. This means each <code>NULL</code> value should be updated with the last value available. The only way I managed to do this is with cursors, which is pretty slow due to the large amount of data. I'm basically searching something like this:</p> <pre><code>UPDATE table AS t1 SET quote = (SELECT quote FROM table AS t2 WHERE t2.tick &lt; t1.tick AND t2.quote IS NOT NULL ORDER BY t2.tick DESC LIMIT 1) WHERE quote IS NULL </code></pre> <p>Of course this query will not work, but this is how it should look like.</p> <p>I would appreciate any ideas on how this can be solved without cursors and temp tables.</p>

14797735	0	Memcache - How to prevent frequent cache rebuilds? <p>I have been working for Memcache for the last week or so, I have managed to work out how to set keys/delete keys. This is fine but Im still attempting to work out how to do the same for a while loop of results. </p> <p>For example I will have a while loop of posts, from within the logic the function will check to see if Memcache is set, if not it will collect the results and create the key. My question is this, <strong>If I have set the looped data into a set key and display the set key (Newest First) Then what happens when a new post is inserted?</strong> I understand I can set a time limit on the set key, but as the content will/could be added whenever it seems that setting a limit could still display old posts. So my question is how would I be able to update the set key. </p> <p>The only way I can think of a possible solution is for when a user inserts a new post, this deletes the key, and when the all posts is viewed again this is when the key gets set again. But this seems rather counter productive, just as if there are 10's of users submitting posts then all the posts will be set over and over again (Doesn't really seem beneficial)</p> <p>I hope this makes sense, any help or guidance would be appreciated.</p>

24274584	0	How do I match lines consisting *only* of four digits and remove lines in betweeen two regexp matches? <p>I need to process a file consisting of records like the following:</p> <pre><code>5145 Xibraltar: vista xeral do Peñón 1934, xaneiro, 1 a 1934, decembro, 31 -----FOT-5011-- Nota a data: extraída do listado de compra. 5146 Xixón: a praia de San Lorenzo desde o balneario ca.1920-1930 -----FOT-3496-- 5147 Xixón: balneario e praia de San Lorenzo ca.1920-1930 Tipos de unidades de instalación: FOT:FOT -----FOT-3493-- </code></pre> <p>I need to remove the 1 to 4 digits record number (i.e.: 5145) and any notes such as "Nota a data: extraída do listado de compra" which always come at the end of the record, after the signature (-----FOT-xxxx--) and before the next record's record number.</p> <p>I've been trying to write an awk program to do this but I don't seem to be able to grasp awk's syntax or regular expressions at all.</p> <p>Here's my attempt to match record numbers, those lines consisting of 1 to 4 digits only. (I think I'm missing the "only" part).</p> <pre><code>$ gawk '!/[[:digit:]]{1,4}/ { print $0 }' myUTF8file.txt </code></pre> <p>Also, I can match these (record signatures):</p> <pre><code>$ gawk '/-----FOT-[[:digit:]]{4}--/ { print $0 }' myUTF8file.txt -----FOT-3411-- -----FOT-3406-- -----FOT-3397-- -----FOT-3412-- ... </code></pre> <p>but I don't know how to remove the lines in between those and the record numbers.</p> <p>Excuse my English and my repeated use of the word record, which I know might be confusing given the topic.</p>
15507314	0	Using Javascript on the Content of an iframe <p>I have a page with some tabbed content on it. A couple of the tabs contain iframes and I use a handy little script to resize the iframes to suit their content. It's</p> <pre><code>function autoResize(id){ var newheight; if(document.getElementById){ newheight=document.getElementById(id).contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight; } newheight=(newheight)+40; // Makes a bit of extra room document.getElementById(id).height= (newheight) + "px"; } </code></pre> <p>Today I have added a little jQuery script to stop the tabbed area showing until it is fully loaded. This stops the tabs doing an unsightly little jump when the loading is complete. This is the script:</p> <pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){ $("#tabber").hide(); $("#loading").hide(); $("#loading").fadeIn(1000); }); $(window).load(function(){ $("#loading").hide(); $("#tabber").fadeIn(300); }); </code></pre> <p>The loading div contains a loading icon and the tabber div is the entire content of the tabbed area.</p> <p>This script is also stopping the iframe resizing working. In order to understand it better I added another script:</p> <pre><code>function checkResize(id){ var win=document.getElementById(id).contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight; alert(win); </code></pre> <p>Sure enough, "win" comes up as zero. If I delete the $("#tabber").hide() line, "win" shows a sensible number for the height of the iframe.</p> <p>Is there another way of making the two things compatible?</p> <p>Vlad produced the solution: I had to use the jQuery version of visibility=hidden instead of the jQuery version of display:none. That doesn't actually exist in jQuery so I found out from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9614622/equivalent-of-jquery-hide-to-set-visibility-hidden">another StackOverflow question</a> how to write my own functions to do it.</p> <p>The final script is</p> <pre><code>(function($) { $.fn.invisible = function() { return this.each(function() { $(this).css("visibility", "hidden"); }); }; $.fn.visible = function() { return this.each(function() { $(this).css("visibility", "visible"); }); }; }(jQuery)); $(document).ready(function(){ $("#tabber").invisible(); $("#loading").hide(); $("#loading").fadeIn(1000); }); $(window).load(function(){ $("#loading").hide(); $("#tabber").visible(); }); </code></pre> <p>My thanks to Vlad, and also RAS, for taking the trouble to look at my question and give their ideas.</p>

I created a php page with my email coding which is executed from a form and submit button on an html page.

36945788	0	Getting Google API Push Notifications for Resources/Rooms <p>I'm trying to get Google Calendar Push Notifications working for Resources (aka Rooms). They work perfectly for user calendars, but when I call/watch on a Resource, it successfully creates. I get the initial "Sync" call on the server, but then I never hear back from Google again.</p> <p>My approach to creating the watch is to authenticate an administrator, and use that Token to add the watch on the resource that the administrator had added as a calendar to his list, so it's showing up in the calendarList/list call. I've also turned on all notifications on the admin's account for that calendar.</p> <p>Any idea on what I might be doing wrong? </p>

21629330	0	How do I embed a JFrame into a JavaFX 2.0 application? <p>I have searched stackoverflow extensively for help on this topic, but the Q&amp;As I found are old and the answers have changed for the current version of the JDK (I'm currently using 7u51). </p> <p>Note that I was never SUPER proficient in Swing to begin with, but I believe I understand the fundamentals. (I've always been more focused on the meat inside an app, not the GUI).</p> <p>I'm trying to work with a third party library. The third party library requires that it's components use JFrame.</p> <p>Therefore, I'm trying to see how I would embed a JFrame into my JavaFX application. There was an old answer about doing something with javafx.ext.swing, but that's no longer included in JavaFX.</p> <p>Help?</p> <p>==========</p> <p>I should also add: I think Java 8, which is currently beta, will support what I need based on this: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/8/embed_swing/jfxpub-embed_swing.htm">http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/8/embed_swing/jfxpub-embed_swing.htm</a> , but I need to see if there is a way to do this without relying on a beta product.</p>

So here is my original question.</p> <p>In my data I have lots of categories, but i'm not interested in estimating coefficients for all of them, I just want to test the hypothesis, that there is no difference in categories. And calling <code>summary</code> on my object produces most information that I don't need for my report.</p> <pre><code>set.seed(42) dat &lt;- data.frame(cat=factor(sample(1:10, 100, replace=T)), y=rnorm(100)) l1 &lt;- lm(y~cat-1, data=dat) summary(l1) </code></pre> <p>How do I extract only the last line from call to <code>summary(l1)</code>?</p> <p>In this particular case I can just used <code>anova</code> function</p> <pre><code>anova(l1) </code></pre> <p>and got only the info that I needed, just in different formatting than <code>summary(l1)</code> produces.</p> <p>What if I have some kind of a summary on an object and I want to extract just particular part of <code>summary(object)</code> how do I do that? For example, how do I get <code>R</code> to print only the line of call <code>summary(l1)</code>?</p> <p>p.s. I am aware of <code>summary(l1)$fstatistic</code>.</p>

2401438	0	MVC Model Implementation? <p>I am creating a simple application using the MVC design pattern where my model accesses data off the web and makes it available to my controllers for subsequent display. </p> <p>After a little research I have decided that one method would be to implement my model as a singleton so that I can access it as a shared instance from any of my controllers.</p> <p>Having said that the more I read about singletons the more I notice people saying there are few situations where a better solution is not possible.</p> <p>If I don't use a singleton I am confused as to where I might create my model class. I am not over happy about doing it via the appDelegate and it does not seem viable to put it in any of the viewControllers.</p> <p>any comments or pointers would be much appreciated.</p> <p><strong>EDIT_001:</strong></p> <p>TechZen, very much appreciated (fantastic answer as always) can I add one further bit to the question before making it accepted. What are your thoughts on deallocating the singleton when the app exits? I am not sure how important this is as I know quite often that object deallocs are not called on app teardown as they will be cleared when the app exits anyway. Apparently I could register the shared instance with NSApplicationWillTerminateNotification, is that worth doing, just curious?</p> <p>gary</p>

26883650	0	Clean HTML table with Reshape2 <p>New user of R. Can't think how to even ask the question. I scraped a webpage for HTML tables. Generally, everything went well, except for one table. Instead of there being 7 separate tables, everything got collapsed into 1 table, with the column name and the value for the first table being two separate columns, and all the other tables being rows. The results is a table with something like this: </p> <pre><code>df &lt;- data.frame(is_employed = c("Hobbies", "Has Previous Experience"), false = c("squash", "false")) </code></pre> <p>Obviously, I need to have the rows (and the column name) in the first column as their own columns, with the item in the second column as their values, preferably with underscores in the columns names. I tried: </p> <pre><code>df &lt;- dcast(df, ~is_employed, value.var = "false") </code></pre> <p>But got an error message. Then I thought to add another column, as such:</p> <pre><code>df2 &lt;- data.frame(number = c(1, 2), is_employed = c("Hobbies", "Has Previous Experience"), false = c("squash", "false")) </code></pre> <p>then I tried </p> <pre><code>df3 &lt;- dcast(df2, number ~is_employed, value.var="false") </code></pre> <p>That placed the values in the first columns as their own columns, but produced two rows (instead of 1), with NAs. I'm sure this is really basic, but I can't figure it out.</p> <p>On edit: I think this gives me what I want, but I'm away from my computer so I can't confirm:</p> <pre><code>library("dplyr") library("tidyr") mat &lt;- as.matrix(df) mat &lt;- rbind(colnames(mat), mat) colnames(mat) &lt;- c("variable", "value") df2 &lt;- as.data.frame(mat) df3 &lt;- df2 %&gt;% mutate(n = 1) %&gt;% spread(variable, value) %&gt;% select(-n) </code></pre> <p>I need to add <code>n</code> or I get NAs, but I don't like it.</p>

16410844	0	Multiple matches for syntax highlighting in VIM <p>I'm writing a syntax file to match a log format (basically column based; think syslog for a similar example), and I'm trying to set up a type of inheritance for columns.</p> <p>I have two main goals with this.</p> <p>First, I want to say that column 3 is the "component" field (let's say it's marked by a header; it could also be at a fixed position) and set the background to, say, Grey. I then want to say that component "foo" gets a foreground color of Red, and component "bar" gets a foreground color of Green, but they should inherit the background color of the "component" column. In this case, the field should really have two syntax matches; this also makes it easy to conceal the entire column (a la <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3853631/toggling-the-concealed-attribute-for-a-syntax-highlight-in-vim">Toggling the concealed attribute for a syntax highlight in VIM</a>)</p> <p>Second, there's a field for levels; I want to set the background of the entire line for a critical level message to Red, but the foreground should be continue to be set via the normal highlighting (component, source, etc; I left off most of the other requirements).</p> <p>From what I can see in the vim documentation, this doesn't seem possible. Am I missing something? Alternatively, can anyone suggest a good workaround?</p> <p>Thanks</p>

I am now trying to make it compatible with Ext 4.2.1 but I ran into this error:</p> <pre><code>[E] Layout run failed </code></pre> <p>Please, see the <a href="http://planysphere.fr/ext/GridPicker/examples/index-4.2.1">demo pages</a> for test cases. The error is raised once for each combo, but only the first time it is expanded.</p> <p>This error didn't happen with 4.2.0 (see <a href="http://planysphere.fr/ext/GridPicker/examples/">demo page with 4.2.0</a>). The breaking changes I had identified in 4.2.1 at the time were about the query filter, not rendering or layout... However, I have already been facing this error with 4.2.0 in a situation where the grid picker was sitting in a window, but it was in a code base with lots of overrides and that used the sandboxed version of Ext4... So I just hopped it was not coming from my component and silenced it (<a href="http://planysphere.fr/ext/GridPicker/examples/benchmark/">another demo page</a> proves that grid picker + window is not enough to trigger the error).</p> <p>The error doesn't seem to have any side effects, but it makes me feel bad.</p> <p>Does anyone know what is causing that or, even better, what must be done to prevent it?</p> <p>Or does someone understand Ext's layout engine well enough to give me some pieces of advice on how to track down this kind of error? Or at least give me reassurance that the error will remain harmless in any situation?</p>

However, I'd like to check that all of my libraries are up to date. In R 3.2.2 , I'm invoking <code>update.packages()</code>. When the function is invoked, I'm prompted to select a CRAN mirror : </p> <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0LKME.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0LKME.png" alt="CRAN mirror selection dialog"></a></p> <p>Assuming everything is fine and this is a non-issue, I select the main ("<code>O-Cloud [https]</code>") mirror from the dialog. The dialog closes and I'm returned to my R prompt with a duplicate message saying "<code>unsupported URL scheme</code>".</p> <p>Simultaneously, I receive an error in my R session upon invoking <code>update.packages()</code>: </p> <pre><code>&gt; getOption("repos") CRAN "@CRAN@" &gt; update.packages() --- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session --- Error in download.file(url, destfile = f, quiet = TRUE) : unsupported URL scheme Warning: unable to access index for repository https://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib: unsupported URL scheme &gt; </code></pre> <p>Considering that perhaps this is an issue with HTTPS, I try a non-SSL mirror and similarly nothing happens (perhaps there are no updates, but I'd like a message that tells me this). However, this time I don't receive the second "unsupported URL scheme" message after the dialog closes : </p> <pre><code>&gt; update.packages() --- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session --- Error in download.file(url, destfile = f, quiet = TRUE) : unsupported URL scheme &gt; </code></pre> <p>It seems that under the hood, R uses a library called RCurl to do some of it's HTTP/S interaction.

21317940	0	Performing calculations on Django database values: views.py, template or Javascript? <p>I have a Django project that interfaces with a PostgreSQL database; one of my tables is about 450 rows long and each row contains about a dozen columns.</p> <p>Each column's value must be put into a different formula to produce the final data I want to display in the template layer, but each row will be processed with the same set of calculations. (In other words, I want to perform 12 different calculations 450 times each.)</p> <p>My question is, of the following methods, which is the generally accepted method of doing so, and which is the best in terms of performance:</p> <p>A) Write each calculation as a model method in models.py, query all objects of interest (again, about 450 of them) in views.py and pass them directly to the template, and then use Django's template language to write things like:</p> <pre><code>&lt;table&gt; {% for item in list %} &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;{{item.name}}&lt;/td&gt; ... &lt;/tr&gt; {% endfor %} &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre> <p>(where <code>.name</code> is a model method)</p> <p>B) Peform the query <em>and</em> calculations in the views.py file and pass the results organized into one big dictionary or list or JSON to the template (and then parse it using template tags),</p> <p>C) Pass all of the objects of interest to the template as in A), but perform calculations on each object's fields using Javascript or jQuery,</p> <p>D) Combine B) and C) to perform all database queries in views.py and then pass the <em>raw</em> values as a big dictionary/list/JSON object to the template and perform calculations on those values using Javascript/jQuery.</p> <p>To my mind, method A) seems the least efficient as it requires you to hit the database a ton of times in the template layer. But it makes writing the view and template extremely simple (just requires you to write 12 different model methods). Method B) seems to follow the general tenet of performing as much logic as possible in your view, and simply passing along the final results to be displayed in the template. But it makes the view function long and ugly. Methods C) and D) put most of load on the end user's browser, which seems like it could really take a load off the server, but then obviously won't work if the user has JS turned off.</p> <p>But again, I'd like to know if there's an accepted best practice for this kind of situation, and whether that contradicts the <em>fastest</em> method from a computational standpoint.</p> <p>And obviously, if I've missed the best method of all, please let me know what it would be.</p>

Also I have used the <code>Otto 2.0-wip</code> lib that is suggested there and not that from <code>Otto Git</code>.</p> <p>This is how I do the implementation:</p> <p>I created a singleton class for the bus: </p> <pre><code>@EBean(scope = EBean.Scope.Singleton) public class BusProviderAA extends BasicBus{ } </code></pre> <p>I declare an object for this class inside <code>my Fragment Class</code> where I want to <code>subscribe</code> at events :</p> <pre><code>@Bean BusProviderAA ottoBus; @AfterInject protected void initAfterInjectMFragment() .... // my stuff here ottoBus.register(this); } @Override public void onStop() { super.onStop(); ottoBus.unregister(this); } @Subscribe public void onChangeUserDetailsEvent(ChangeUserDetailsEvent mEvent){ Log.e(" s onChangeUserDetailsEvent", "ss onChangeUserDetailsEvent"); if(mEvent.msg.contains("Data_changed")){ //TODO } } </code></pre> <p>I post event to the bus from <code>my communicator class</code> when it gets <code>callback</code> from server communication. This is how I <code>post event</code> to my bus inside this class:</p> <pre><code>@Bean //To use this enhanced class in another enhanced class or in an enhanced Android component, use @Bean: BusProviderAA ottoBus; public void callbackResponse(....){ ....// my stuff here and after callback ottoBus.post(changeUserDetailsEvent(serverResponse.getMsg())); } @Produce public ChangeUserDetailsEvent changeUserDetailsEvent(String msg){ return new ChangeUserDetailsEvent(msg); } </code></pre> <p>And this is my <code>ChangeUserDetailsEvent</code> class:</p> <pre><code>public class ChangeUserDetailsEvent { public final String msg; public ChangeUserDetailsEvent(String msg) { this.msg = msg; } } </code></pre> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> My problem is that my method which is subscribed at bus event <code>onChangeUserDetailsEvent</code> doesnt get called and I dont even know how to debug to fix this problem. </p> <p>I should mention that bus event works perfectly when I implement it in a <code>Fragment</code> that doesn't use Annotations, and a <code>Bus</code> singleton without Annotation. This is the Bus singleton class when I don't use Annotations:</p> <pre><code>public class BusProvider { private static final Bus BUS = new BasicBus(); // me lib public static Bus getInstance(){ return BUS; } private BusProvider(){} } </code></pre> <p>Thanks!</p> <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p> <p>I also have a problem when I update to <code>androidannotations:3.2</code> changing my <code>gradle file</code> from:</p> <p><code>compile 'org.androidannotations:androidannotations:3.1' apt 'org.androidannotations:androidannotations:3.1'</code> </p> <p>to: </p> <p><code>compile 'org.androidannotations:androidannotations:3.2' apt 'org.androidannotations:androidannotations:3.2'</code>. </p> <p>For version 3.1 it compiles but doesnt work <code>otto event bus</code>.

13959172	0	Issue with JSON sending <p>Hey guys so I am trying to have a JSON send over a value to another page in wordpress to create a session once a image is clicked on. </p> <p>Here is the JSON code:</p> <pre><code>$('.item-post a').click(function() { var prodname = $('#hiddenpostitle'); $.post('/overviewcheck-515adfzx8522', { 'ProdName': prodname.val() }, function(response) { }, 'json' ); }); </code></pre> <p>The #hiddenposttitle is the following: <code>&lt;?php echo "&lt;input type='hidden' value='$title' id='hiddenpostitle' name='hiddenpostitle'/&gt; "?&gt;</code></p> <p>So this sends to the overviewcheck page, which then has a template that has the follow:</p> <pre><code>&lt;?php /* Template Name: overviewbackcheck */ session_start(); $prodname= $_POST['ProdName']; $_SESSION['overviewprod'] = $prodname; ?&gt; </code></pre> <p>Someone mentioned something about wordpress destroying sessions from calling session_start() but that's not the issue because I fixed that awhile ago, and have other sessions being made that work. It has to do something with the JSOn sending over and I am not to sure.</p> <p>From here the overview page is opened with the following:</p> <pre><code>$(function() { $('.item-post a').colorbox({opacity:0.3, href:"../overviewa512454dzdtfa"}); }); </code></pre> <p>This is the colorbox code that will open the file the within the file I have:</p> <pre><code>&lt;?php echo $_SESSION['overviewprod']; ?&gt; </code></pre> <p>to echo it out. </p> <p>Ultimately I am unable to echo out a session and it does not seem anything is being made.</p> <p>If you could help me out that would be awesome because I need this finished! :)</p>

27886245	0	How to change the URL after a navigation using jQuery Mobile's $.mobile.navigate <p>I'm new to jQuery Mobile and I've been trying so hard (been googling for 2 days straight) to understand how the navigation to external pages works but finding it really hard so hopefully I can get a proper explanation here. From my searches I've found the <code>$.mobile.navigate</code> function but I haven't quite figured out how exactly to use it. </p> <p>Basically what I have is a <code>login.php</code> page, after you successfully logged in you should be taken to the <code>homepage.php</code>, I've managed to make it so that the <code>homepage.php</code>'s content is shown, but when it comes to the URL I can see for a split second that it changes to <code>homepage.php</code> but immidiately changes back to <code>login.php</code>. How can I make it so that it stays on <code>homepage.php</code>? </p> <p>I navigate to <code>homepage.php</code> with <code>$.mobile.navigate</code> like so:</p> <pre><code>&lt;input type="submit" form="login-form" name="submit_login" value="Logga in" id="submit-login"&gt; $('body').on('click', '#submit-login', function() { $.mobile.navigate('../../includes/pages/homepage.php'); }); </code></pre> <p>And currently my <code>homepage.php</code> file looks like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;div data-role="page" data-url="homepage" data-theme="b" id="homepage"&gt; &lt;div data-role="header"&gt;Some content here&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div data-role="main"&gt;Some content here&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div data-role="footer"&gt;Some content here&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre> <p>I read somewhere that <code>data-url</code> is used for changing the url on navigation but I haven't been able to make any use of it from my attempts. </p>

RecyclerView item contains two textviews which displays simple text like this :</p> <pre><code> TextTitle TextValue --&gt; item1 TextTitle TextValue --&gt; item2 TextTitle TextValue --&gt; item3 </code></pre> <p>If User taps on text value, its value gets changed (Value is binary so it will be only two). If user change first two item's value by tapping and I want to restore those two values when I will come back to this fragment with a help of restore/save state.</p> <p>I followed many articles and gather information that if I have to use proper unique id in item's view layout for both textviews then recyclerview state will be stored automatically, only just you need to save whole recyclerview state. Its not working in my case. What am I doing wrong? Do I need to fill adapter again?</p> <p>any help would be appreciated.</p> <pre><code> @Override public void onSaveInstanceState(@NonNull Bundle outState) { super.onSaveInstanceState(outState); outState.putParcelable(INSTANCE_STATE_CONTENT_RECYCLER_VIEW,recyclerView.getLayoutManager().onSaveInstanceState()); } // again restore it restore it if (recyclerViewState != null) { recyclerView.getLayoutManager().onRestoreInstanceState(recyclerViewState); recyclerViewState = null; } @Override public void onViewBound(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) { //super.onViewBound(savedInstanceState); if (savedInstanceState != null) { recyclerViewState = savedInstanceState.getParcelable(INSTANCE_STATE_CONTENT_RECYCLER_VIEW); } // continue with my work. } </code></pre>
8791424	0	Setting ASP.NET Cache control headers <p>In my asp.net forms app. I'm trying to prevent caching of certain pages. to do so I've set a series of cache control headers using Response.AppendHeader e.g.</p> <pre> protected override void OnLoad(Eventargs e) { ... Response.ClearHeaders(); Response.AppendHeader("Cache-Control","no-cache"); .... base.OnLoad(e); } </pre> <p>Trouble is when I view my site and look at the Net tab in the Firefox console to view the request/response headers I see a behavior as follows:</p> <ol> <li><p>a POST request/response for the page1.aspx which triggers a redirect (to page2.aspx) the response here contains the correct headers. </p></li> <li><p>a GET request/response for page2.aspx associated response has the cache-control header just has a value 'pre-check=0'</p></li> </ol> <p>That second request seems to allow the caching to happen for the page.. note: page1.aspx and page2.aspx both have the OnLoad logic I describe above. Also if I take some action on page2.aspx, the POST response will again have the correct headers.</p> <p>What am I missing here? My expectation was that with the logic in OnLoad should mean that I always get the headers in the response and therefore 'always' get the current version of the page? </p> <p>What I'm seeing is firefox loading it's cached version of the page.</p> <p>I'm considering creating a random identifier in the request url to force the matter, but that seems a little heavy handed.</p> <p>-----update----- It seems that, this may be related to having the caching code in 'OnLoad'. I've added these headers to the Page_Load() of the page and it works fine? any thoughts.</p>

20036644	1	Python 3: check if the entire list is inside another list <p>Let's say I have 2 lists:<br> <code>a = [6,7,8,9,10]</code><br> <code>b = [1,3,4,6,7,8,9,10]</code> </p> <p>I have a function that is used to find out if <em>list a</em> can be found in <em>list b</em>. If it is found, then it returns <strong>True</strong>. In my case it should return <strong>True</strong> because <em>list a</em> can be found at the end of <em>list b</em>. <em>List a</em> never changes and always contains the same numbers, whereas <em>list b</em> accepts numbers from the user and then uses <code>sorted()</code> method to sort numbers in ascending order. I should also add that the order does matter. </p> <p>I have searched around and could find a subset method, which looks like this: <code>set(a).issubset(set(b)))</code> as well as using <code>in</code> method. Both of them did not work for me.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Using <code>set(a).issubset(set(b)))</code> for some reason always returns True. For example, if <code>a = [1,1]</code> and <code>b = [0,1,2,3,4,5]</code> then using subset method returns True, even though 1,1 cannot be found in b. I'm not looking if 1 is inside the list, I'm looking if 1,1 is inside the list.</p> <p>Using <code>in</code> method when<br> <code>a = [6,7,8,9,10]</code><br> <code>b = [1,3,4,6,7,8,9,10]</code> returns False.</p>

7894221	0	How to log into git bitbucket repository from jenkins <p>I have a GIT repository on bitbucket, which I want my Jenkins Server to access automatically. This is only possible using public/private key authentication. So I created a key pair and uploaded the public key to bitbucket. The public and the private key are on my server in the .ssh folder of the tomcat user running jenkins. I am able to clone my project when I am logged in as that user on the server.</p> <p>However I am unable to get jenkins to actually check out the code from bitbucket. It always says:</p> <pre><code>Permission denied (publickey). fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly </code></pre> <p>Well I assume that this happens because when accessing the repository over ssh I need to provide the passphrase for my private key and jenkins is unable to do this automatically. I read that it is possible to avoid beeing asked for the passphrase by providing a config file inside the .ssh folder containing the following content:</p> <pre><code>Host bitbucket.org IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa </code></pre> <p>I did so, but as soon as I provide that file I can no longer clone the repository from bitbucket. Not even directly from the server, getting the same error message as shown above.</p> <p>Did anyone manage to make this setup work? I also read the following thread here on stackoverflow that was of no use to me: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6323434/how-do-i-set-a-private-ssh-key-for-hudson-jenkins-to-access-bitbucket">How do i set a private ssh key for hudson / jenkins to access bitbucket?</a> and I checked that tomcat really runs under user tomcat6 by creating an empty test project that simply runs "whoami".

Of course with <code>Required background modes: App plays audio or streams audio/video using AirPlay</code> in <code>info.plist</code> already set. Once the music starts playing, it keeps playing even if i go to the background.</p> <p>I don't want to use UILocalNotificaation sound coz it's limited to 30 secs and only the able to play the sounds that are bundled with the application.</p> <p>Any insights ? thoughts ?? </p> <p>Sample code:</p> <pre><code> var notif = UILocalNotification() notif.fireDate = self.datePicker.date notif.alertBody = "test" UIApplication.sharedApplication().scheduleLocalNotification(notif) </code></pre> <p>the above code gets called when the user selects and alarm and clicks save.</p> <p>and here's what's happening in AppDelegate:</p> <pre><code>func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: NSDictionary?) -&gt; Bool { NSLog("launched") application.registerUserNotificationSettings(UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: UIUserNotificationType.Sound | UIUserNotificationType.Alert | UIUserNotificationType.Badge, categories: nil )) AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback, error: nil) AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setActive(true, error: nil) self.sound = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource("sound", ofType: "caf")) self.audioPlayer = AVAudioPlayer(contentsOfURL: sound, error: nil) return true } func application(application: UIApplication!, didReceiveLocalNotification notification: UILocalNotification!){ audioPlayer.play() NSLog("received local notif") } </code></pre> <p>You need to hold a strong reference to the <code>AVAudioPlayer</code> btw, so it won't get released, and the <code>audioplayer.play()</code> won't do anything...</p>

This is being done as follows: </p> <pre><code>cv::Mat dst(row, col, CV_64F, &amp;tmpVec); </code></pre> <p>And thrn i run PCA on it as:</p> <pre><code>cv::PCA pca(dst, cv::Mat(), CV_PCA_DATA_AS_ROW, 2); </code></pre> <p>When I try printing it out on screen after PCA computation i end up with garbage values. I just need to figure out how to run PCA on a 2D double vector. Any help with this or pointing me in the right direction would be great. Thanks in advance.</p>

4076169	0	How remove "installed twice" errors in RCP Product <p>I have an RCP product based on 2 features: my product feature and the org.eclipse.rcp feature. It worked perfectly at export time and at run time.</p> <p>Last week I decided to add the error log view to my product. I simply added the view to my "persective" and the logview plugin as plugin dependency in my main plugin. Just work fine !!!</p> <p>After exporting my product (through headless build) I noticed that when launching my product I have a lot of errors in the error log view (not acceptable for customers even if all is working fine). These errors are related to the RCP feature plugins and say:</p> <p>the plugin org.eclipse.xxx (one error for each plugin of the RCP feature) has already been installed from /plugins/org.eclipse.xxx </p> <p>Any idea on the way to avoid these errors ? I guess this means I have something wrong in my product configuration.</p>

These classes implement ISerializable which, doesn't like to play nice with the WCF service when I update.</p> <p>I need to leave the ISerializable attribute on there because it is being used else where is some older code.

27712919	1	SQLAlchemy: order_by(None) for joinedload subclause queries? <p>We are using SQLAlchemy 0.9.8 on Python 2.7.7 and Postgres 9.3.</p> <p>We have a query that uses joinedloads to fully populate some Recipe objects using a single query. The query creates a large SQL statement that takes 20 seconds to execute - too long. Here's the <a href="http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=ETNDAeAa" rel="nofollow">rendered SQL statement on Pastebin</a>. </p> <p>The rendered SQL has an ORDER BY clause that Postgres explain says is the source of 99% of the time spent on this query. This appears to come from the relationship in the ORM model, which has an order_by clause.</p> <p>However, we don't care about the order the results are returned for this query - we only care about the order when looking at a single object. If I remove the ORDER BY clause at the end of the rendered SQL statement, the query executes in less than a second - perfect.</p> <p>We tried using .order_by(None) on the query, but that seems to have no effect.

36835788	0	Webdesign: Wrapping table suppresses scrollbars in IE 11 and Firefox <p>We have to get a legacy web application to run in Internet Explorer 11 and Firefox. The application does not set any doctype and therefore sends both browsers into quirks mode.</p> <p>We have a table that needs to be scrollable, which is embedded in a div with overflow: auto. This works on its own, but our web application embeds this div again in a table and wraps the table with another two divs. See the fiddle here:</p> <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/Tim_van_Beek/y7hsp1zp/3/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/Tim_van_Beek/y7hsp1zp/3/</a></p> <p>(Please use IE 11 or Firefox, the page does not work in Chrome at all.)</p> <p>The wrapping table (the first -node in the HTML tree) seems to suppress the scrollbars. They reappear when one removes it. So while this structure does not have scrollbars (see fiddle above): </p> <pre><code>&lt;div style="overflow: hidden;..."&gt; &lt;div ...&gt; &lt;table width="auto" height="auto" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td width="100%" height="100%" align="left" valign="top"&gt; &lt;div style="overflow: auto;"&gt; ...table data to be scrolled </code></pre> <p>...this one does (remove the table, tbody, tr and td tags):</p> <pre><code>&lt;div style="overflow: hidden;..."&gt; &lt;div ...&gt; &lt;div style="overflow: auto;"&gt; ...table data to be scrolled </code></pre> <p>It would seem that one needs to format the table in a certain way to get it to display scrollbars again (or rather: not suppress the scrollbars of its child node), any suggestions? </p> <p>We cannot simply remove the table from our application without compromising the rest of the layout, but we can add/modify css at will.</p>

29993697	0	Leaflet map in ionic/angular map displays grey tiles <p>I'm working on a mapping app using ionic and leaflet. Note that I am not using the leaflet angular directive, I am using straight JS for the leaflet map (I know, I know...).</p> <p>The initial state in my app loads the leaflet map just fine. If I switch to another state and back to the map everything is also fine. However, if I launch the app, switch to a different state and open a modal window in that state, then return to the original state, the map is broken and displays a number of grey tiles. The map will not update until the browser window resizes or the orientation of the mobile device is changed.</p> <p>Here's a demo on Plunker: <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/w67K2b?p=preview" rel="nofollow">http://plnkr.co/edit/w67K2b?p=preview</a>. To reproduce:</p> <ol> <li>Click the button at the right side of the navbar which will take you to a different state.</li> <li>Click the 'Back to map' button to go back to the original state. The map looks just fine.</li> <li>Click the button in the navbar again.</li> <li>Click the 'Open modal' button and then close the modal.</li> <li>Click the 'Back to map' button and you will see that the map is now broken.</li> </ol> <p>I've seen other people report issues with grey tiles, which typically can be resolved with a call to:</p> <pre><code>map.invalidateSize() </code></pre> <p>Unfortunately this does not resolve my issue. I'm pretty much a newb, but I think the problem is that when the modal opens, the invalidateSize() method in the leaflet source code is run, since the map div is not visible, the 'size' gets set to x:0, y:0 which ends up breaking the map when I transition back to the original state.</p> <p>I'm not really sure where to go from here. Perhaps I can use JS to dynamically resize the div and trick leaflet into thinking a resize event has occurred? How would I do this? Any other thoughts?</p> <p>Thanks!</p>

I followed <a href="http://www.htmlxprs.com/post/6/creating-a-realtime-image-sharing-app-with-ionic-and-socketio-tutorial" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a> to make the chat application which uses Socket.io.</p> <p>When I used this tutorial the server is listening at port 8000 whereas the client is running at port 8100. The Socket URL is at 8000 and the chat application is working perfectly. However when I try to use methods of Express such as <code>app.get()</code>, I cant seem to make it work. I think the cause is that the port of the local host is 8100 and I am listening on 8000. I am using <code>app.get()</code> and AngualrJS to authenticate using PassportJS. Please can someone help me out as I have been stuck on this for a while. Thanks and I would really appreciate any help. Maybe I am thinking about this the wrong way.</p>

The defaults (debug and release, each with custom settings), and dev and beta build type (also with custom signing, custom proguard and custom applicationIdSuffix.</p> <p>What I now want to do is to build the app package with for example the buildType beta (gradle clean assembleBeta). That starts building the app in beta, sees that it has a dependency to wear, and starts building wear. BUT here's the problem. The wear module is being built with the release build type instead of the same beta-build-type I used to initiate the build.</p> <p>The custom build type configuration is exactly the same on the two modules, and thus manually building the wear module with beta build type does work. But having a wear module built with beta and packaged inside the app module also built with beta does not work.</p> <p>Any ideas how I can achieve that?</p>

The image floor.jpg that I want as the background of the canvas is 1200X700. I want the canvas to be 100% of the page width and height.

2692829	0	HTTP Response 412 - can you include content? <p>I am building a RESTful data store and leveraging Conditional GET and PUT. During a conditional PUT the client can include the Etag from a previous GET on the resource and if the current representation doesn't match the server will return the HTTP status code of 412 (Precondition Failed). Note this is an Atom based server/protocol.</p> <p>My question is, when I return the 412 status can I also include the new representation of the resource or must the user issue a new GET? The HTTP spec doesn't seem to say yes or no and neither does the Atom spec (although their example shows an empty entity body on the response). It seems pretty wasteful not to return the new representation and make the client specifically GET it. Thoughts?</p>

Also I am defaulting the opacity of the checkbox to 0.5 opacity when no action is taken upon it.</p> <p>With the code I have, I get the warnings</p> <p><strong>Possible unintended reference comparison; to get a value comparison, cast the left hand side to type 'string'</strong></p> <p>Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong.

18359122	0	postgres, contains-operator for multidimensional arrays performs flatten before comparing? <p>The following query:</p> <pre><code>SELECT ARRAY[[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]] @&gt; ARRAY[2, 3, 5]; </code></pre> <p>gets responded with true and not false as expected, since the <code>array[2, 3, 5]</code> doesn't exist in the source array.

4251945	0	Symfony Actions Namespacing, or a better way? <p>In Rails, you can organize controllers into folders and keep your structure nice with namespacing. I'm looking for a similar organizational structure in Symfony 1.4.</p> <p>I was thinking of organizing multiple actions.class.php files in an actions folder, but all I came across was using independent action files, one for each action... like this:</p> <pre><code># fooAction.class.php class fooAction extends sfActions { public function executeFoo() { echo 'foo!'; } } </code></pre> <p>But I'd have to develop a whole new routing system in order to fit multiple actions into that file, which is... silly.</p> <p>Really I'm just looking to make Symfony into Rails, (again, silly, but I'm stuck with Symfony for this project) so I'm wondering if there's a better way....?</p> <p>Thanks.</p>

29016131	0	SVG: Why <p> element is not displaying in <foreignobject> <p>I'm attempting to put a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element inside a <code>&lt;foreignobject&gt;</code> inside an <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> node in chrome but I am not seeing the text. I have inspected the element and the DOM model shows the structure I expect. I created this <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/ujzL8yyr/" rel="nofollow">jsfiddle</a> by copying from the DOM model and lo and behold it works exactly as I desire in the fiddle.</p> <p>After scratching my head for a bit I started looking at the properties in the two tabs (both in Chrome) and the only 2 things at this point that jump out me are that when I hover over the <code>&lt;foreignobject&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element in the fiddle, it shows a grey box the area where it's displayed. When I do this in the real application, it does the same for the <code>&lt;foreignobject&gt;</code> but I see nothing for the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. The second difference is that in the fiddle, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element shows a height and a width of 54px and 100px (respectively) but in the actual application they both are reported to be 'auto'.</p> <p>As an experiment, I attempted to set the height and width explicitly in the CSS for 'p' but chrome just shows this as an 'invalid property'.</p> <p>Assuming this is the problem, I'm a little lost as to how to control a property that I'm not allowed to specify. Can someone help with some advice on how to debug this further? There's clearly something about what I am doing that is causing this but I'm not sure where to look next.</p> <p>EDIT:</p> <p>I don't know why I didn't notice this before but I see a difference that may help explain this. The fiddle shows the properties for the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element as:</p> <ul> <li>p.description</li> <li>HTMLParagraphElement</li> <li>HTMLElement</li> <li>Node</li> <li>EventTarget</li> <li>Object</li> </ul> <p>The application shows these properties:</p> <ul> <li>p</li> <li>SVGElement</li> <li>Element</li> <li>Node</li> <li>EventTarget</li> <li>Object</li> </ul> <p>I assume this has something to do with how d3 is adding the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. I will try to create a fiddle that creates the elements with d3.</p>

It doesn't work if I try to set up the menubar in the MainWindow initialization but does work if I set it up in some external function. That is, the following does NOT work:</p> <pre><code>import sys from PyQt4 import QtGui class MyMainWindow(QtGui.QMainWindow): def __init__(self, parent=None): super().__init__(parent) centralWidget = QtGui.QWidget() menubar = QtGui.QMenuBar() menu = QtGui.QMenu("File") menu.addAction("New") menubar.addMenu(menu) self.setMenuBar(menubar) self.setCentralWidget(centralWidget) if __name__ == "__main__": app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv) mainWindow = MyMainWindow() mainWindow.show() sys.exit(app.exec_()) </code></pre> <p>While if I simply move the menu setup down to the main routine:</p> <pre><code>class MyMainWindow(QtGui.QMainWindow): def __init__(self, parent=None): super().__init__(parent) if __name__ == "__main__": app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv) mainWindow = MyMainWindow() centralWidget = QtGui.QWidget() menubar = QtGui.QMenuBar() menu = QtGui.QMenu("File") menu.addAction("New") menubar.addMenu(menu) mainWindow.setMenuBar(menubar) mainWindow.setCentralWidget(centralWidget) mainWindow.show() sys.exit(app.exec_()) </code></pre> <p>Then the menu is created (I know I don't have any actions hooked up, this is stripped down to show the oddity).

25358040	0	AngularJS with ui-router: Changing value of a parent dependency of from child's controller <p><strong>Environment</strong>: AngularJS application (using UI Router) that has nested states.</p> <p><strong>Short version:</strong> How do I change the value of a parent-state's dependency from inside a child's controller, such that siblings of the child state, who are also using the dependency will get the new value.</p> <p><strong>Long version</strong>: Take the following configuration:</p> <pre><code>shopApp.config(function($stateProvider) { $stateProvider.state('shop', { url : '/shop', templateUrl : 'shop.html', resolve : { user : function($q) { // callback that ends up returning null // because the user is not logged in } }, controller: function($scope, user) { // user is null at this point $scope.user = user; } }).state('shop.login', { url : '/login', templateUrl : 'login.html', controller : function($scope) { // onLoggedIn is called from some form-processing // logic once the user has successfully logged in $scope.onLoggedIn = function(userObject) { // I want the shop.userDetails state's controller // to get the new $scope.user value $scope.user = userObject; $state.go('^.userDetails'); }; } }).state('shop.userDetails', { url : '/userDetails', templateUrl : 'userDetails.html', controller : function($scope, user) { // Unfortunately user is null here $scope.user = user; } }); }); </code></pre> <p>The <em>shop.login</em> state's controller has a function called <em>onLoggedIn</em> that's called once the user has logged in successfully. An object containing user-information is passed to this function. From this point on I want all resolutions of the <em>user</em> dependency to use this value (i.e <em>userObj</em>). Unfortunately, instead of using the value that I've just assigned to <em>$scope.user</em>, it seems that the value that gets passed to the controller of <em>shop.userDetails</em> is the one that was originally resolved when the <em>shop</em> state's controller was created.</p> <p>Does anyone know how to do this? If I'm doing this all wrong please tell me.</p>

23072707	0	Are Aggregate Roots just Entities with invariants over their contents? <p>A <code>Network</code> is composed of <code>Node</code>s that are connected with <code>Fiber</code>s. The <code>Network</code> is responsible for making sure that:</p> <ol> <li>both ends of any fiber are connected to a <code>Node</code>; </li> <li>that no two ends are connected to the same <code>Node</code>;</li> <li>that no two nodes can be in the same (x, y) location;</li> <li>a network has a limit of 10 nodes and 10 fibers.</li> </ol> <p>Both the <code>Network</code>, the <code>Node</code> and the <code>Fiber</code> are information-rich (they have a name, a date when they were deployed, etc), and it looks to me as if <code>Network</code> is an Aggregate Root (as its the container of both <code>Node</code>s and <code>Fibers</code> and forces invariants between them).</p> <p>I'm at this point also sure that <code>Node</code> and <code>Fiber</code> are entities, and that they are also probably Aggregate Roots.</p> <p>One possible implementation of the <code>Network</code> class might be as follows:</p> <pre><code>class Network { private final NetworkId id; private String name; private Location location; ... private final Map&lt;FiberId, Fiber&gt; fibers = new HashMap&lt;FiberId, Fiber&gt;(); private final Map&lt;NodeId, Fiber&gt; nodes = new HashMap&lt;NodeId, Node&gt;(); } </code></pre> <p>which poses a big problem if my use case is just to edit the location or the name of the <code>Network</code>. In that case I just don't care about fibers and nodes and realistically, it is expected them to be quite possible for their numbers to be on the order of 10k-100k nodes/fibers! How should I approach this issue? Should I separate the definition of a <code>Network</code> (containing <code>fibers</code> and <code>nodes</code> and their invariants) from the rest of the fields? </p> <p>I've always thought of Aggregate Roots as Entities that have a set of invariants to hold over its attributes, in contrast with Entities that just don't care abouts the state of their attributes (for instance, a Person defined with a name and age wouldn't probably need to have any kind of checking for invalid combinations of name and age).</p> <p>Following this philosophy, I generally tend to decide whether some domain concept is either a Value, Entity, Value or Event and then if it's an Entity, if it's an Aggregate Root. Is my assumption flawed?</p> <p>Thanks</p>

5213630	0	Suspend and Resume thread (Windows, C) <p>I'm currently developing a heavily multi-threaded application, dealing with lots of small data batch to process.</p> <p>The problem with it is that too many threads are being spawns, which slows down the system considerably. In order to avoid that, I've got a table of Handles which limits the number of concurrent threads. Then I "WaitForMultipleObjects", and when one slot is being freed, I create a new thread, with its own data batch to handle.</p> <p>Now, I've got as many threads as I want (typically, one per core). Even then, the load incurred by multi-threading is extremely sensible. The reason for this: the data batch is small, so I'm constantly creating new threads.</p> <p>The first idea I'm currently implementing is simply to regroup jobs into longer serial lists. Therefore, when I'm creating a new thread, it will have 128 or 512 data batch to handle before being terminated. It works well, but somewhat destroys granularity.</p> <p>I was asked to look for another scenario: if the problem comes from "creating" threads too often, what about "pausing" them, loading data batch and "resuming" the thread?</p> <p>Unfortunately, I'm not too successful. The problem is: when a thread is in "suspend" mode, "WaitForMultipleObjects" does not detect it as available. In fact, I can't efficiently distinguish between an active and suspended thread.</p> <p>So I've got 2 questions:</p> <ol> <li><p>How to detect "suspended thread", so that i can load new data into it and resume it?</p></li> <li><p>Is it a good idea? After all, is "CreateThread" really a ressource hog?</p></li> </ol> <p><strong>Edit</strong></p> <p>After much testings, here are my findings concerning Thread Pooling and IO Completion Port, both advised in this post.</p> <p>Thread Pooling is tested using the older version "QueueUserWorkItem". IO Completion Port requires using CreateIoCompletionPort, GetQueuedCompletionStatus and PostQueuedCompletionStatus;</p> <p>1) First on performance : Creating many threads is very costly, and both thread pooling and io completion ports are doing a great job to avoid that cost. I am now down to 8-jobs per batch, from an earlier 512-jobs per batch, with no slowdown. This is considerable. Even when going to 1-job per batch, performance impact is less than 5%. Truly remarkable.</p> <p>From a performance standpoint, QueueUserWorkItem wins, albeit by such a small margin (about 1% better) that it is almost negligible.</p> <p>2) On usage simplicity : Regarding starting threads : No question, QueueUserWorkItem is by far the easiest to setup. IO Completion port is heavyweight in comparison. Regarding ending threads : Win for IO Completion Port. For some unknown reason, MS provides no function in C to know when all jobs are completed with QueueUserWorkItem. It requires some nasty tricks to successfully implement this basic but critical function. There is no excuse for such a lack of feature.</p> <p>3) On resource control : <strong>Big win</strong> for IO Completion Port, which allows to finely tune the number of concurrent threads, while there is no such control with QueueUserWorkItem, which will happily spend all CPU cycles from all available cores. That, in itself, could be a deal breaker for QueueUserWorkItem. Note that newer version of Completion Port seems to allow that control, but are only available on Windows Vista and later.</p> <p>4) On compatibility : small win for IO Completion Port, which is available since Windows NT4. QueueUserWorkItem only exists since Windows 2000. This is however good enough. Newer version of Completion Port is a no-go for Windows XP.</p> <p>As can be guessed, I'm pretty much tied between the 2 solutions. They both answer correctly to my needs. For a general situation, I suggest I/O Completion Port, mostly for resource control. On the other hand, QueueUserWorkItem is easier to setup. Quite a pity that it loses most of this simplicity on requiring the programmer to deal alone with end-of-jobs detection.</p>

14118997	0	How to Upload With ASP.NET <p>I know I might get a lot of downvotes for this, but I cannot find the information anywhere. I am trying to upload my compiled web application to the internet. I was told that all I need is the dll file which is supposed to go into the bin folder? Is this true or do I need to upload both the dll file and the bin folder?</p> <p>Also, is there a better way to build so that I dont have to intermix my image, css, and so on into my project folder? Maybe a way to copy the dll file to a bin folder and all my aspx pages?</p> <p>I got it to work but it seems like I keep duplicating a bunch of files and I know eventually some problem will arise.</p> <p>Thanks and happy new year to everyone.</p>

Until now all my research has been about converting integers to strings etc, but I suspect that I'm barking up the wrong tree. And perhaps my question title is misleading too, but here's my scenario.</p> <p>I am working on a quiz app that stores all the questions and answers in a .json file in the following format:</p> <pre><code>{ "id" : "1", "question": "Earth is a:", "answers": [ "Planet", "Meteor", "Star", "Asteroid" ], "difficulty": "1" } </code></pre> <p>The correct answer is <strong>always</strong> the one listed first within the .json file.</p> <p>The app presents the question with the four possible answer buttons (which have been shuffled using the following code):</p> <pre><code> func loadQuestions(index : Int) { let entry : NSDictionary = allEntries.objectAtIndex(index) as! NSDictionary let question : NSString = entry.objectForKey("question") as! NSString let arr : NSMutableArray = entry.objectForKey("answers") as! NSMutableArray //println(question) //println(arr) labelQuestion.text = question as String let indices : [Int] = [0,1,2,3] //let newSequence = shuffle(indices) let newSequence = indices.shuffle() var i : Int = 0 for(i = 0; i &lt; newSequence.count; i++) { let index = newSequence[i] if(index == 0) { // we need to store the correct answer index currentCorrectAnswerIndex = i } let answer = arr.objectAtIndex(index) as! NSString switch(i) { case 0: buttonA.setTitle(answer as String, forState: UIControlState.Normal) break; case 1: buttonB.setTitle(answer as String, forState: UIControlState.Normal) break; case 2: buttonC.setTitle(answer as String, forState: UIControlState.Normal) break; case 3: buttonD.setTitle(answer as String, forState: UIControlState.Normal) break; default: break; } } </code></pre> <p>Once a button is pressed, the app checks the answer chosen with the following code:</p> <pre><code>func checkAnswer( answerNumber : Int) { if(answerNumber == currentCorrectAnswerIndex) { // we have the correct answer labelFeedback.text = "Correct!" labelFeedback.textColor = UIColor.greenColor() score = score + 1 labelScore.text = "Score: \(score)" totalquestionsasked = totalquestionsasked + 1 labelTotalQuestionsAsked.text = "out of \(totalquestionsasked)" accumulatedquestionsasked = accumulatedquestionsasked + 1 percentagecorrect = score / totalquestionsasked SaveScore() SaveBestScore() // later we want to play a "correct" sound effect PlaySoundCorrect() } else { // we have the wrong answer labelFeedback.text = "Wrong!" labelFeedback.textColor = UIColor.blackColor() totalquestionsasked = totalquestionsasked + 1 labelTotalQuestionsAsked.text = "out of \(totalquestionsasked)" accumulatedquestionsasked = accumulatedquestionsasked + 1 SaveScore() SaveBestScore() // we want to play a "incorrect" sound effect PlaySoundWrong() } } </code></pre> <p>So, what I'd like to do is change the labelQuestion text to present the correct answer if the user was wrong. </p> <p>I've tried a few options as follows:</p> <pre><code>labelQuestion.text = "The correct answer was: \(currentCorrectAnswerIndex)" </code></pre> <p>and</p> <pre><code>labelQuestion.text = "The correct answer was: \(currentCorrectAnswerIndex)" as string </code></pre> <p>and</p> <pre><code>let answertext = String(currentCorrectAnswerIndex) labelQuestion.text = "The correct answer was: \(answertext)" </code></pre> <p>All of these attempts have the same outcome - they provide the integer value corresponding to the button with the correct answer. For example, the user is presented with a message like:</p> <p><em>The correct answer was: 2</em> <strong>instead of</strong> <em>The correct answer was: Planet</em></p> <p>I know I must be making a newbie mistake, but any direction would be much appreciated. I'm using the latest version of Xcode / Swift.</p>

27240585	0	Private namespaces for library sub-modules using prototype <p>I'm working on a large JavaScript UI module, think about something in the dimension of iScroll. For keeping the thing sane, I split the library up into several logical sub-modules (like: touch interaction, DOM interaction, etc.) that communicate with each other using a simple pubsub system.</p> <p>Each of these sub-modules has it's own namespace I use for storing variables. To enable several instances of the library running at the same time, the constructor includes some logic to copy every namespace that has been assigned to a 'toCopy' object directly into every new instance.</p> <p>The basic structure looks something like this:</p> <pre><code>// constructor function Constructor() { for (var key in this.toCopy) { // create a deep copy and store it inside the instance this[key] = utils.copyObj(this.toCopy[key]); } } Constructor.prototype.toCopy = {} // sub-module #1 Constructor.prototype.toCopy._module1Namespace = {} Constructor.prototype._privateFn = function() { /** do stuff within this._module1Namespace or send events */ } Constructor.prototype._privateFn = function() { /** do stuff within this._module1Namespace or send events */ } // sub-module #2 Constructor.prototype.toCopy._module2Namespace = {} Constructor.prototype._privateFn = function() { /** do stuff with this._module2Namespace or send events */ } Constructor.prototype._privateFn = function() { /** do stuff with this._module2Namespace or send events */ } </code></pre> <p>My problem: I really dislike having to expose the namespace of each sub-module to the rest of the library. Although I'm disciplined enough not to access the namespace of sub-module #1 within a function of sub-module #2, I want it to be technically impossible.</p> <p>However, as several instances of the UI library have to run at the same time, I cannot put every sub-module inside a closure and define a private namespace inside this closure. This would result in every instance of the library accessing the same sub-module closure and therefore the same namespace.</p> <p>Also, putting everything inside the constructor instead of into the prototype would create a new set of functions for every new instance, which somehow contradicts the idea of a good library.</p> <p>My research hasn't brought up any useful patterns for this problem so far, I'm thankful for all suggestions.</p>

I can normally work around most problems by reading online, but when it comes to linux and ssh I cant - it's too complex. No two explanations seem the same.</p> <p>The problem is this:</p> <p>I launched an EC2 instance using the bitnami wordpress ami (i think its an ami?) and everything works great. </p> <p>Im super excited about this new wordpress project called VersionPress, link below. </p> <p>I managed to install git and get a tick in that box. Now I need to satisfy the plugin's requirements for write permission on several folders.</p> <p>I've been reading up on chmod, and checking out what permission are currently in place using ssh, but can not, for the life of me, make sense of it. </p> <p>The info on what VersonPress needs is here: <a href="http://docs.versionpress.net/en/getting-started/installation-uninstallation" rel="nofollow">http://docs.versionpress.net/en/getting-started/installation-uninstallation</a></p> <p>If we take for example the plugins own folder /versionpress, I can navigate to it and see the current permissions using ls:</p> <p>drwxr-xr-x 7 bitnami bitnami ... versionpress</p> <p>So I'm like ok, I suppose I'd better give group write permissions. But, no version of the chmod command I write will execute and even then, it's only one of the folders that I need to change. </p> <p>UPDATE: I added '~' and got chmod working on the /versionpress dir</p> <p>As a next step I tried to change rights on /wordpress dir. This was initially unsuccessful until I applied command with Sudo. </p> <p>VersionPress still reports it does not have the correct permissions however. </p> <p>Error msg: VersionPress needs write access in the site root, its nested directories and the system temp directory. Please update the permissions.</p> <p>END UPDATE</p> <p>Anyone experienced this, got VersionPres up and running on EC2 or with any advice to move me forward? </p> <p>Thanks.</p>

The linkout opens in a pop up and single sign on works (siteminder passing the sm user cookie), but as soon as I perform any transaction on the linked application I am thrown out stating the session is either timed out or invalid. </p> <p>I looked at the cookies present on the browser and found that both the JSESSION IDs are present. The only difference is in the domain scope of both the JSESSION IDs. App1 application has domain scope of say abc.com whereas App2 has app2.abc.com </p> <p>I tried changing the name of the JSESSION ID cookie of App2 but the application did not work with the renamed JSESSION cookie. </p> <p>Any suggestion on how can I fix this ?</p> <p>Note : The environment for App2 is was5 </p> <p>Regards AVN</p>

40596310	0	Drop down value replicates in nog options Angular <p>I have a dynamically generated html table that adds rows based on the record that is displayed. I'm adding a column that will contain a dropdown. I used ng-options for it, however every time I change one record, the rest are also updated. Tried changing it to ng-repeat and get the same result. See code below:</p> <pre><code> &lt;td&gt; &lt;select class="form-control" ng-model="$ctrl.selectedRC" ng- options="r.ccd as (r.OName + ' -- '+ r.RCName) for r in $ctrl.RC track by r.ccd"&gt; &lt;/select&gt; &lt;!--if I have 5 records, all dropdowns in the table change --&gt; &lt;/td&gt; </code></pre> <p>Using ng-repeat:</p> <pre><code> &lt;select class="form-control" ng-model="$ctrl.selectedRC" &lt;option value="" ng-selected="true"&gt;--Select one--&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option ng-repeat="r in $ctrl.RC" value="{{r.OName}}" ng-selected="{{r.OName === selectedRC}}"&gt;{{r.RCName}} &lt;/option&gt; &lt;/select&gt; </code></pre> <p>I know that these two are currently displaying two different things (one a concatenated set of values, the other juts one). But my main interest is to figure out how to have each <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> have its own dropdown without affecting the rest of the rows.</p>

5159431	0	Java reverse server communication <p>I have two machines. One machine is a client and the other is a server running JBoss. I have no trouble having the client make requests and the server respond to those requests. However, for a new project that I need to do I have to reverse the roles. I have to implement a push model, so the server will need to make requests from the client. Specifically I need the server to be able to ask the client for files in a directory, copy files from the server to the client, and run programs on the client. I'd like to do this without adding a psedo server on the client (a small daemon process).</p> <p>Is there a good way to do this?</p> <p>Thanks</p> <p>EDIT: So it would appear that I have to set up a server on the client machine to do what I need because I need to have the server push to the client while the client is not running the Java process (but the machine is on). With that in mind, what's the lightest weight Java server?</p>

For example, what if I build solution with MSBuild and then generate this script with some tool? I believe, that if I read assembly as byte array and then serialize it to hex string and insert into script template - it could work, but maybe there is some easier standard solution?</p> <p>Thanks.</p>

Here is my code:</p> <pre><code>package payroll_program_3; import java.util.Scanner; public class payroll_program_3 { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner input = new Scanner( System.in ); employee_info theEmployee = new employee_info(); String eName = ""; double Hours = 0.0; double Rate = 0.0; while(true) { System.out.print("\nEnter Employee's Name: "); eName = input.nextLine(); theEmployee.setName(eName); if (eName.equalsIgnoreCase("stop")) { return; } System.out.print("\nEnter Employee's Hours Worked: "); Hours = input.nextDouble(); theEmployee.setHours(Hours); while (Hours &lt;0) //By using this statement, the program will not { //allow negative numbers. System.out.printf("Hours cannot be negative\n"); System.out.printf("Please enter hours worked\n"); Hours = input.nextDouble(); theEmployee.setHours(Hours); } System.out.print("\nEnter Employee's Rate of Pay: "); Rate = input.nextDouble(); theEmployee.setRate(Rate); while (Rate &lt;0) //By using this statement, the program will not { //allow negative numbers. System.out.printf("Pay rate cannot be negative\n"); System.out.printf("Please enter hourly rate\n"); Rate = input.nextDouble(); theEmployee.setRate(Rate); } System.out.print("\n Employee Name: " + theEmployee.getName()); System.out.print("\n Employee Hours Worked: " + theEmployee.getHours()); System.out.print("\n Employee Rate of Pay: " + theEmployee.getRate() + "\n\n"); System.out.printf("\n %s's Gross Pay: $%.2f\n\n\n", theEmployee.getName(), theEmployee.calculatePay()); } } } </code></pre> <p>AND</p> <pre><code>package payroll_program_3; public class employee_info { String employeeName; double employeeRate; double employeeHours; public employee_info() { employeeName = ""; employeeRate = 0; employeeHours = 0; } public void setName(String name) { employeeName = name; } public void setRate(double rate) { employeeRate = rate; } public void setHours(double hours) { employeeHours = hours; } public String getName() { return employeeName; } public double getRate() { return employeeRate; } public double getHours() { return employeeHours; } public double calculatePay() { return (employeeRate * employeeHours); } } </code></pre>
2761489	0	SVN - Retrieve history of item "replaced into" existing directory <p>I created a branch from my SVN trunk. In the branch, another developer deleted a directory, but then readded it with the same files. When I merged the changes from the branch back into the trunk (using TortoiseSVN), this directory had a "replace into" message. I unfortunately merged those in (none of these files in the branch had changed, but since it was deleted and added, it showed up as a change). Now, the history for those files only goes back to the time it was readded in the branch. I have the old history in a tag from before the merge, but it is a pain to have to go to that to get the history.</p> <p>Is there a way to update the files to get the history back into the trunk? Even if I merge the tag into the trunk, would it actually update the full history? I have a feeling it would just merge any file changes, not the history.</p>
37652378	0	Local passport authorization on different ports <p>I have a node.js application running on port 5000, where I use passport.js as authorization. I authorize users from a post request, where I use a custom callback:</p> <pre><code>this.router.post('/member/login', (req, res, next) =&gt; { passport.authenticate('local', (err, member, info) =&gt; { if (err) res.json(400).json({message: "An error ocurred"}); if (!member) { console.log("No member found!"); return res.status(409).json({message: "No member found!"}) } req.logIn(member, (err) =&gt; { if (err) { console.log(err); return res.status(400).json({message: "An error ocurred"}); } return res.json(member); }); })(req, res, next); }); </code></pre> <p>This works fine, but when I develop local I have a frontend Angular2 application, which runs on a different port (4200), so in my development I am not possible to get the authorized user: req.user is undefined. I use express-session to store the authorized user.</p> <p>When I deploy I bundle both applications up together, so everything works. </p> <p>Does anyone have a good and simple solution for this issue? Again it's only in development I have this problem.</p>

I need a feature for uploading user files which could be of size more that 1 GB. This feature will be an add-on to the existing file-upload feature present in the application which caters to smaller files. Now, here are some of the options</p> <ol> <li>Use HTTP and Java applet. Send the files in chunks and join them at the server. But how to throttle the n/w.</li> <li>Use HTTP and Flex application. Is it better than an applet wrt browser compatibility &amp; any other environment issues?</li> <li>Use FTP or rather SFTP rather than HTTP as a protocol for faster upload process</li> </ol> <p>Please suggest.</p> <p>Moreover, I've to make sure that this upload process don't hamper the task of other users or in other words don't eat up other user's b/w. Any mechanisms which can be done at n/w level to throttle such processes?</p> <p>Ultimately customer wanted to have FTP as an option. But I think the answer with handling files programmatically is also cool.</p>

12476828	0	Sony Smartwatch widget refresh <p>I have a Problem with my Sony SmartWatch App. I've developed a widget with control, but after the App is installed by users on the device the scheduled refresh task of the widget starts automatically. This means the refresh task is running all the time, even if the user did not turn on SmartWatch Display or start the widget. This drains the battery. If I go to the widget screen and then turn the display from off, the scheduled Task stops like expected. But if I don't do this the task is running and running and running.... How can I detect if the Display is on and the widget is running?</p> <p>Thank you very much!</p> <p>P.S.: It makes no difference if the "Activate Widget" preference is checked or not....</p> <p>EDIT: I've found out that the widget sourcecode does not fire if I uncheck the "Display as Widget" Checkbox in preferences. This means if the refresh schedule is running and I uncheck this box, the onDestroy is never called and so the cancel schedule also not....</p>

But when I switch to Sony LT29i, there will always be a status 133 when I'm trying to write into a certain characteristic. I will give out some brief code.</p> <pre><code>BluetoothGattService syncService = gatt.getService(SYNC_DATA_SERVICE); BluetoothGattCharacteristic tChar = syncService.getCharacteristic(SYNC_TIME_INPUT_CHAR); if (tChar == null) throw new AssertionError("characteristic null when sync time!"); int diff = /*a int*/; tChar.setValue(diff, BluetoothGattCharacteristic.FORMAT_SINT32, 0); gatt.writeCharacteristic(tChar); </code></pre> <p>and the onCharacteristicWrite function:</p> <pre><code>@Override public void onCharacteristicWrite(BluetoothGatt gatt, BluetoothGattCharacteristic characteristic, int status) { Log.d(TAG, String.format("Sync: onCharWrite, status = %d", status)); try { if (status != BluetoothGatt.GATT_SUCCESS) throw new AssertionError("Error on char write"); super.onCharacteristicWrite(gatt, characteristic, status); if (characteristic.getUuid().equals(SYNC_TIME_INPUT_CHAR)) { BluetoothGattService syncService = gatt.getService(SYNC_DATA_SERVICE); BluetoothGattCharacteristic tChar = syncService.getCharacteristic(SYNC_HEIGHT_INPUT_CHAR); if (tChar == null) throw new AssertionError("characteristic null when sync time!"); tChar.setValue(/*another int*/, BluetoothGattCharacteristic.FORMAT_SINT32, 0); gatt.writeCharacteristic(tChar); } else if { ... } } catch (AssertionError e) { ... } </code></pre> <p>Writing into first characteristic has nothing wrong and control will reach the onCharacteristicWrite and enter the first <code>if</code> statement with status <code>0</code>, which means success. Problem is the second writing action in the <code>if</code> statement, which will also trigger onCharacteristicWrite function but yield a status <code>133</code>, which cannot be found in <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGatt.html">the official site</a>. Then the device disconnect automatically.</p> <p>I've confirmed that the data type and the offset are all correct. And because in another device it works really nice, I think there might be some tiny differences of the bluetooth stack implementation between different device that I should do something more tricky to solve this problem.</p> <p>I've search for result for a long time. Some results lead me to the C source code(Sorry, I will post the link below because I don't have enough reputation to post more than 2 links), but I can only find that <code>133</code> means GATT_ERROR there, which is not more helpful than just a <code>133</code>. I've also found a issue in google group, discussing some familiar questions, but I failed to find a solution here.</p> <p>I'm a little bit sad because, if it is something wrong with the C code, even if I can locate what's wrong, I still have no way to make it right in my own code, right?</p> <p>I hope that someone has the familiar experience before and may give me some suggestions.

40079029	0	how to prompt a pop up message right after user input in jtextfield <p>I am new in Java and now trying to develop a simple program to support my research findings. In this program, I'll be displaying randomized images and users were to enter single integer in jtextfield provided. The users are required to count and answer the number of animals displayed. Since I want to develop the program as simple as possible, I imagine my tool will be straight forward. </p> <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> There will be a JTextField provided for user to input their answer. Is there any coding that could restrict user input right after a single integer(between 1-6) has been keyed in the box? As I need my program to be straight forward and easy to understand, I do not want user to click on any button so as to lead them to next image. May I know is there any way to restrict user input and lead the program to next image right after user enter a number without clicking any button? <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/erLvu.jpg" rel="nofollow">Question 1</a></p> <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Right after the user key in the single integer answer, I would like to prompt a simple popup that includes a praise to user such as "Well done". Since the JOptionPane I'll be using will contain two buttons: "OK" and "cancel", may I know how to make sure the program leads to next randomized image after user click on "OK" button. <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cUMMl.jpg" rel="nofollow">Question 2</a></p> <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Is there any ways to keep the input cursor for typing just in the JTextField provided?

I want my program to work like: everytime user enter a single integer, a pop up message appear, user click "OK" and lead to next randomized image. At the next image, user just have to enter the answer without moving the cursor to click at the jtextfield(Example:By referring to image question 2, after user click "OK", how to make the program leads to next randomized image as image question 1).

2646694	0	Running job in the background from Perl WITHOUT waiting for return <h3>The Disclaimer</h3> <p>First of all, I know this question (or close variations) have been asked a thousand times. I really spent a few hours looking in the obvious and the not-so-obvious places, but there may be something small I'm missing.</p> <h3>The Context</h3> <p>Let me define the problem more clearly: I'm writing a newsletter app in which I want the actual sending process to be async. As in, user clicks "send", request returns immediately and then they can check the progress in a specific page (via AJAX, for example). It's written in your traditional LAMP stack.</p> <p>In the particular host I'm using, PHP's exec() and system() are disabled for security reasons, but Perl's system functions (exec, system and backticks) aren't. So my <del>workaround</del> solution was to create a "trigger" script in Perl that calls the actual sender via the PHP CLI, and redirects to the progress page.</p> <h3>Where I'm Stuck</h3> <p>The very line the calls the sender is, as of now:</p> <pre><code>system("php -q sender.php &amp;"); </code></pre> <p>Problem being, it's not returning immediately, but waiting for the script to finish. I want it to run in the background and have the system call itself return right away. I also tried running a similar script in my Linux terminal, and in fact the prompt doesn't show until after the script has finished, even though my test output doesn't run, indicating it's really running in the background.</p> <h3>What I already tried</h3> <ul> <li>Perl's exec() function - same result of system().</li> <li>Changing the command to: "php -q sender.php | at now"), hoping that the "at" daemon would return and that the PHP process itself wouldn't be attached to Perl.</li> <li>Executing the command 'indirectly': "/bin/sh -c 'php -q sender.php &amp;'" - still waits until sender.php is finished sending.</li> <li>fork()'ing the process and executing the system call in the child (hopefully detached process) - same result as above</li> </ul> <h3>My test environment</h3> <p>Just to be sure that I'm not missing anything obvious, I created a sleeper.php script which just sleeps five seconds before exiting.

37843609	0	Angular 2 testcomponentbuilder does not work with several directives from third party libraries <p>I am writing unit tests for my angular 2 component with Jasmine framework and somehow Jasmine always skips my spec if I include directives not from the angular original module (in my case the test only works with directives for example from angular/core and angular/common). This is my app component:</p> <pre><code>import {Component, Input, OnInit} from '@angular/core'; import {NgStyle} from '@angular/common'; import { CollapseDirective } from 'ng2-bootstrap/components/collapse'; import {MdButton} from '@angular2-material/button'; import { MdDataTable } from 'ng2-material'; import { EntityFilterPipe } from './entity-filter.pipe'; import { NgFor } from '@angular/common'; @Component({ selector: 'test', templateUrl: 'app/entity.html', pipes: [EntityFilterPipe], directives: [NgStyle, NgFor, CollapseDirective] }) export class EntityTestComponent implements OnInit { public title = 'Entities'; @Input() name:string; showSearch: boolean = true; listFilter:string; toggleSearch(): void { this.showSearch = !this.showSearch; } ngOnInit() { console.log("printed"); } } </code></pre> <p>And this is my spec:</p> <pre><code>import {describe, it, beforeEach, inject, expect, beforeEachProviders } from '@angular/core/testing'; import { ComponentFixture, TestComponentBuilder } from '@angular/compiler/testing'; import { EntityTestComponent } from './entity-test.component'; export function main() { describe('Entity component', () =&gt; { let tcb: TestComponentBuilder; beforeEachProviders(() =&gt; [TestComponentBuilder, EntityTestComponent]); beforeEach(inject([TestComponentBuilder], (_tcb: TestComponentBuilder) =&gt; { tcb = _tcb })); it('should display no item found when item is not on the list', done =&gt; { //expect(true).toBe(true); tcb.createAsync(EntityTestComponent).then(fixture =&gt; { let property = fixture.componentInstance; expect(property.showSearch).toBe(true); done(); }) .catch(e =&gt; done.fail(e)); }); </code></pre> <p>The spec is run if I only include NgStyle and NgFor in my list directives. When I tried including anything from different libraries, such as CollapseDirective or MdDataTable, the spec is skipped -- jasmine test does not show success or failure. Any suggestion is much appreciated! Thanks</p>

33927174	1	Django reverse url to onetoonefield on success <p>Good day SO!</p> <p>Recently I've started working on Django, got myself a situation which I can't find the right solution on the web to solve it. So I've got a little question about URL reversing on a success. Currently when an user successfully creates an account, the user gets reversed to a profile based on the user_id which just got created: </p> <pre><code>class Create(CreateView): form_class = UserCreateForm # inherits from django's UserCreationForm def get_success_url(self): return reverse('users:profile', kwargs={'pk': self.object.pk}) </code></pre> <p>This is working properly. Now I created a profile module with a OneToOneField to the django.auth.models User model. When creating a new account, a signal is send to the create_profile_on_registration method.</p> <pre><code>@receiver(post_save, sender=User) def create_profile_on_registration(sender, created, instance, **kwargs): ... </code></pre> <p>This is also working properly, a new profile is created on user account registration. Now I would like to reverse the user to the new created profile_id instead of the user_id. However, I cant figure out exactly how to get this properly to work. Can you give me a little push in the right direction on how to approach this issue? I can't match up the right google search words or find any examples which explains or shows how to achieve this properly.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p>

33260553	1	Using PyperClip on web app <p>I am using pyperclip.py to grab a list of E-Mail Addresses in my web app using a form so a user can paste it locally via clipboard. It works perfect locally.

How can I get it to copy to the clipboard of the client's system? </p> <p>Right now I'm just trying to get it to work and as such I'm only using a single line. I'm using pyperclip 1.5.15 with xclip and Python 3.4. The server is running Linux 14.04 and the client has noticed issues on Windows 8 and Windows 10 using Google Chrome and IE. No other os has currently been tested. </p> <pre><code>pyperclip.copy("HELLO") </code></pre>
36445189	0	libcurl use same user defined port to send periodic request <p>I am working on a project need to send periodic alive message to https server.</p> <p>Because of security issue, we need to use minimal number of ports (blocking unused ports as many as we can).</p> <p>I am using c++ libcurl easy interface to send https request in linux.</p> <p>I have tried to use the same curl handler object (CURL object) and set CURLOPT_LOCALPORT to a port number. The first request is ok. But in the second, libcurl verbose mode said address already in use. However, when I comment out the port set through CURLOPT_LOCALPORT, it works on second connection also, and by setting VERBOSE to 1, I can see "Re-using existing connection" print out, which is missing in version setting up local port. And I check with linux netstat, find out that it is using the same port. I cannot figure out why setting up local port will make it failed.</p> <p>And also, I have tried to close the connection using curl_easy_cleanup, but due to tcp time_wait state, we cannot reuse the port in a while, that's not what I want.</p> <p>Could anyone provide a solution or suggestion to us? Thanks a lot.</p> <p><strong>Edit</strong> My reason using one port is not to keep opening and closing connection too much.</p>

10784772	0	Drawing a line with a brush in iOS <p>there are so many posts here, were people ask how to draw lines with a brush in CGContext. The answer always is: Use a pattern. However, I tried this for some hours now and the main problem to me seems to be: It seems like CoreGraphics simply draws the pattern as a fill and then simply clips this pattern with the stroke of the path you specified. This leads to some bad looking tile-borders and it simply doesn't look as someone really draws something by hand. What I want is something were the brush is painted along the path, without any clipping. I basically want to move along the path and simply draw the brush image every x points, in distance, on the path, with the size of the brush. Is this somehow possible with CoreGraphics or is this just something you have to implement on your own?</p> <p>//EDIT: Sorry, I thought it was clear what I tried by saying, I used a pattern. This is what I did so far:</p> <pre><code>struct CGPatternCallbacks patternCallback = {0, drawChalkPattern, NULL}; CGAffineTransform patternTransform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(.25f, .25f); UIImage* brush = [UIImage imageNamed:@"ChalkBrush"]; CGPatternRef pattern = CGPatternCreate(NULL, (CGRect){CGPointZero, brush.size}, patternTransform, brush.size.width, brush.size.height, kCGPatternTilingConstantSpacingMinimalDistortion, true, &amp;patternCallback); CGColorSpaceRef patternSpace = CGColorSpaceCreatePattern(NULL); CGContextSetStrokeColorSpace(context, patternSpace); CGFloat color[4] = {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}; CGContextSetStrokePattern(context, pattern, color); CGContextDrawPath(context, kCGPathStroke); </code></pre> <p>and than this is the patternCallback function:</p> <pre><code>void drawChalkPattern(void * info, CGContextRef context) { UIImage* pattern = [UIImage imageNamed:@"ChalkBrush"]; CGContextDrawImage(context, (CGRect){CGPointZero, pattern.size}, [pattern CGImage]); } </code></pre> <p>Best regards, Michael</p>
10798274	0	Opening a database connection in a constructor, when should I close it? <p>well, I've been thinking of making database requests a little faster by keeping the connection to the database open as long as the object is being used. So I was thinking of opening the connection in the constructor of that class. Now the question is, how can I close the connection after I stopped using? I have to call close() somewhere, don't I? I've been reading about the finalize() method, but people seemed to be skeptical about usage of this method anywhere at all. I'd expect it to have something like a destructor, but Java doesn't have that, so?</p> <p>So could anyone provide me with a solution? Thanks in advance.</p>

27536672	1	A dict-like class that uses transformed keys <p>I'd like a dict-like class that transparently uses transformed keys on lookup, so that I can write</p> <pre><code>k in d # instead of f(k) in d d[k] # instead of d[f(k)] d.get(k, v) # instead of d.get(f(k), v) </code></pre> <p>etc. (Imagine for example that <code>f</code> does some kind of canonicalization, e.g. <code>f(k)</code> returns <code>k.lower()</code>.)</p> <p>It seems that I can inherit from <code>dict</code> and override individual operations, but not that there is a centralized spot for such transformation that all keys go through. That means I have to override all of <code>__contains__</code>, <code>__getitem__</code>, <code>get</code>, and possibly <code>__missing__</code>, etc. This gets too tedious and error-prone, and not very attractive unless this overhead outweighs that of manually substituting <code>f(k)</code> for every call on a plain <code>dict</code>.</p>

13629575	0	How to use SSH with PuTTY using a proxy server? <p>This is a journey that doesn't seem to have an end. Please bear with the story.</p> <p>I am wanting to write a variety of Perl programs that connect to an SSH server. The server is a Mac, the client is Windows behind an HTTP proxy. PuTTY works perfectly to connect, but executing the Perl scripts isn't ideal, for several reasons.</p> <p>I want to have an interactive (not with the user, but with the software running on the server) Perl program running on the client and the server, a la how rsync works with the -e option.</p> <p>First step, how do I connect? I use plink (from PuTTY), which has a variety of useful options... tunneling, running a series of commands, etc. From there, I can easily run commands and scripts on the server and get back the result, process the result, and then do the next command. But this is SLOW because it has to renegotiate the PuTTY/SSH connection each time. Hence the desire for an interactive approach.</p> <p>When running plink in this manner, I could interact with the plink command, but I'm having trouble with double-piping (input and output, never mind triple-piping to also get STDERR). I tried everything on <a href="http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/perl2/prog/ch16_03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/perl2/prog/ch16_03.htm</a> and nothing worked. Got various errors, etc.</p> <p>Next I tried writing my own client/server programs using sockets. Worked pretty well, except for some reason each time I run the SocketServer on the server program and then connect to it (using plink to tunnel localhost to the server's port), the port closes itself off and refuses future connections. So I have to change the port every time, which seems counterproductive (probably an issue with my code, but I don't see it).</p> <p>The next step was trying Expect.pm. However, that seems to only work under Linux or CYGWIN, which I don't want to get too deep into. This needs to stay native Windows as much as possible.</p> <p>My latest is looking into Net::SSH::Perl and other SSH modules. I set up a port 22 tunnel with plink and then in CYGWIN I try:</p> <pre><code>ssh user@localhost </code></pre> <p>I enter my password and all is wonderful! Works like a champ!</p> <p>So then I try the following program (again, with the port 22 tunnel established)</p> <pre><code>use Net::SSH::Perl; my $ssh = Net::SSH::Perl-&gt;new('localhost'); $ssh-&gt;login('&lt;user&gt;','&lt;pass&gt;'); my($stdout, $stderr, $exit) = $ssh-&gt;cmd('ls -l'); while (&lt;$stdout&gt;) { print; } </code></pre> <p>(user and pass above are substituted for the real user and pass) I can see the plink tunnel opening the forwarded port, but the program returns</p> <pre><code>Permission denied at E:\Scripts\ExplorationScripts\NetSSHPerl.pl line 3 </code></pre> <p>So, this is where I am... I have many more SSH Perl modules to try, but I was wondering if anyone else had this situation. I see tons of people using PuTTY and SSH stuff, but none of them are going through a proxy (and thus NEED PuTTY). And I don't have the time or patience to mess with something like corkscrew, so please let's not go down that particular rabbit hole.</p> <p>I'm open for suggestions...</p> <p>Thanks.</p> <p>... continuing the journey... the new thing I've tried, and y'all will probably laugh at this bass-ackward solution... I tunneled port 23 through the Mac to a Windows machine on the same network running Telnet. Then, using Net::Telnet I am able to telnet to the Windows machine. Very awkward. I also wanted to be able to establish the tunnel and then kill it at the end of the program, so I added some oddball stuff. Check it out and PLEASE help me get a better solution to this.</p> <pre><code>use Net::Telnet; #establish tunnel open my $tunnel,"| plink -L 23:&lt;local IP of windows machine&gt;:23 &lt;server&gt; -pw &lt;pass&gt;"; sleep 7; #Now it's time to do the telnet boogie! my $t=new Net::Telnet ( Timeout=&gt;10, Errmode=&gt;'return',Prompt =&gt; '/&gt;$/'); #$t-&gt;output_log('telnet.log'); $t-&gt;input_log('telneti.log'); $t-&gt;open("localhost"); $t-&gt;login('&lt;user&gt;','&lt;pass&gt;'); @lines = $t-&gt;cmd("dir /b"); print @lines; $t-&gt;close(); print $tunnel "exit\n"; close $tunnel; </code></pre> <p>The $tunnel thing is the weirdness. plink will establish a terminal session, so I opened a handle to it's STDIN via the pipe. The -L establishes the tunnel. When I'm done with the telnetting, I print "exit" to plink which exits the bash session. I also use the "sleep 7" to give it enough time to establish the session. Ugh! But it seems to work moderately well.</p>

19506163	0	How to correctly chain conditional(?) promises with Q.js <p>I've still not quite got a complete understanding of promises so apologies if this is a simple misunderstanding.</p> <p>I have a function for deleting an item on a page but I have a specific behaviour depending on the state of the page. Psuedo code-wise it's something like this:</p> <pre><code>Does the page have changes? If yes - prompt to save changes first If yes - save changes If no - exit function If no - continue Prompt to confirm delete If yes - delete item and reload data If no - exit function </code></pre> <p>Hopefully that makes sense. Essentially if there are changes, the data must be saved first. Then if the data has been saved, or if there were no changes to begin with, prompt the user to confirm deletion. The problem is I'm using durandal and breeze, and I can't seem to chain the promises they return together correctly.</p> <p>My function currently looks like this, which I know is wrong, but I'm struggling to work out where to fix it.</p> <pre><code>if (this.hasChanges()) { app.showMessage('Changes must be saved before removing external accounts. Would you like to save your changes now?', 'Unsaved Changes...', ['Yes', 'No']) .then(function (selectedOption) { if (selectedOption === 'Yes') { return this.save(); } else { Q.resolve() } }); } app.showMessage('Are you sure you want to delete this item?', 'Delete?', ['Yes', 'No']) .then(function (selectedOption) { if (selectedOption === 'Yes') { item.entityAspect.setDeleted(); datacontext.saveChanges() .then(function () { logger.logNotificationInfo('Item deleted.', '', router.activeInstruction().config.moduleId); Q.resolve(this.refresh(true)); }.bind(this)); } }.bind(this)); </code></pre> <p>The app.showMessage call from durandal returns a promise, then the this.save returns a promise, and finally the this.refresh also returns a promise.</p> <p>So I guess I need to check the hasChanges, then if necessary call save, and resolve it. Then after that conditional section has finished resolving, call the second prompt, and then resolve all the promises within that.</p> <p>I'm sorry I don't think this is super clear, but that's also I think coming from the fact I'm not completely following the chains here.</p> <p>Any help much appreciated! Thanks.</p>

3932774	0	divide 64bit in two 32bit registers by 32bit <p>I am trying to write an x86 emulator in JavaScript for education purposes. I have already written a compiler and at the moment I am trying to write the x86 emulator in JavaScript.</p> <p>I have however a problem with the DIV instruction. According to <a href="http://siyobik.info/index.php?module=x86&amp;id=72" rel="nofollow">http://siyobik.info/index.php?module=x86&amp;id=72</a> DIV takes a 64bit number as input by interpreting EDX as the higher 32bit and EAX as the lower 32bit. It then divides this number by the DIV parameter and puts the result (if it is not greater than 0xFFFFFFFF) into EAX and the remainder into EDX.</p> <p>As JavaScript does not support 64bit integer I need to apply some tricks. But so far I did not come up with something useful.</p> <p>Does someone here have an idea how to implement that correctly with 32bit arithmetic?</p>

20128267	0	C++ binary files and iterators: getting away with a 1:1 using ifstreambuf_iterator? <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13665583/2485710">This answer</a> points out the fact that C++ is not well suited for the iteration over a binary file, but this is what I need right now, in short I need to operate on files in a "binary" way, yes all files are binary even the .txt ones, but I'm writing something that operates on image files, so I need to read files that are well structured, were the data is arranged in a specific way.</p> <p>I would like to read the entire file in a data structure such as <code>std::vector&lt;T&gt;</code> so I can almost immediately close the file and work with the content in memory without caring about disk I/O anymore.</p> <p>Right now, the best way to perform a complete iteration over a file according to the standard library is something along the lines of</p> <pre><code>std::ifstream ifs(filename, std::ios::binary); for (std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt; &gt; it(ifs.rdbuf()); it != std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt; &gt;(); it++) { // do something with *it; } ifs.close(); </code></pre> <p>or use <code>std::copy</code>, but even with <code>std::copy</code> you are always using <code>istreambuf</code> iterators ( so if I understand the C++ documentation correctly, you are basically reading 1 byte at each call with the previous code ).</p> <p>So the question is: how do I write a custom iterator ? from where I should inherit from ?</p> <p>I assume that this is also important while writing a file to disk, and I assume that I could use the same iterator class for writing, if I'm wrong please feel free to correct me.</p>

[I think]. It is only for interactive stuff, doesn't go to another page or anything else. I see a lot of developers do this.</p> <p>I feel like its the wrong thing to do though. Is there another recommended way to do this without using HTML attributes a way where it is not suppose to be used?</p> <p>Not using <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> ether because the link would not be a button.</p> <p>Maybe without a hash?</p> <pre><code>&lt;a class="trigger"&gt; Click Me &lt;/a&gt; </code></pre> <p>&amp; in CSS:</p> <pre><code>.trigger { cursor: pointer; } </code></pre> <p>So the user still knows its for something that you should click?</p>

I created a site that has a lot of div and what I want is that when a link is clicked only one div will be displayed without reloading the whole page.</p> <p>Sample code:</p> <pre><code>&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Div 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Div 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Div 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div id="content1"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is content 1&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id="content2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is content 2&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id="content3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is content 13&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre> <p>Is it possible if I'll just use php?

13646954	1	swig generated code, generating illegal storage class for python wrapper of C++ API <p>I'm trying to take the approach of using swig with the main header file. It seems like swig will work doing this, but I've run into some problems. I asked a first question about it <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13581600/compiling-swig-extension-with-coledatetime-for-python">here on stackoverflow</a> and while I haven't yet been successful, I've made enough progress to feel encouraged to continue...</p> <p>So now, here's my interface file:</p> <pre><code>/* File : myAPI.i */ %module myAPI %{ #include "stdafx.h" #include &lt;boost/algorithm/string.hpp&gt; ... many other includes ... #include "myAPI.h" #include &lt;boost/algorithm/string/predicate.hpp&gt; #include &lt;boost/filesystem/path.hpp&gt; #include &lt;boost/filesystem/operations.hpp&gt; using boost::format; using namespace std; using namespace boost::algorithm; using namespace boost::serialization; %} /* Let's just grab the original header file here */ %include "myAPI.h" </code></pre> <p>As far as I can tell swig runs just fine. However, in the generated code it produces numerous definitions like this one:</p> <pre><code>SWIGINTERN int Swig_var_ModState_set(PyObject *_val) { { void *argp = 0; int res = SWIG_ConvertPtr(_val, &amp;argp, SWIGTYPE_p_MY_API, 0 | 0); if (!SWIG_IsOK(res)) { SWIG_exception_fail(SWIG_ArgError(res), "in variable '""ModState""' of type '""MY_API""'"); } if (!argp) { SWIG_exception_fail(SWIG_ValueError, "invalid null reference " "in variable '""ModState""' of type '""MY_API""'"); } else { MY_API * temp; temp = reinterpret_cast&lt; MY_API * &gt;(argp); ModState = *temp; if (SWIG_IsNewObj(res)) delete temp; } } return 0; fail: return 1; } </code></pre> <p>Visual Studio 2010 complains with an error for each of these code blocks. The error is based on the <code>temp</code> var:</p> <pre><code>2&gt;c:\svn\myapi\myapi_wrap.cxx(3109): error C2071: 'temp' : illegal storage class </code></pre> <p>I tried just to add a global declaration of this variable as an int to the swig generated _wrap.cxx file, but it didn't not work. (clearly a naive approach...).</p> <p>Does anyone have some insight as to what I need to do to avoid this error?</p> <p>Thanks in advance! </p>
36578070	0	Google Cloud Messaging IP address <p>I have made an android application with GCM enabled service in it which works on localhost. User needs to register in order save the device id in the database which would help administrator to send push notifications to the user. Since, the database is on localhost, registration works fine on emulator. But after installing the app on phone, the device does not get registered. Due to unsuccessful registration, the details do not get entered into the database. After searching a bit, found out the problem as the ip address. IP address on pc is different than the address taken by phone even via same router. Is there any solution for this problem? I really need to run the app on the phone and not just on emulator. Thanks in advance!</p>

I cant see it in html DOM anywhere when inspecting. I added simple alert(1) in it to check if it will run, and it does, although rest of the code doesnt - and i dont get any errors. So how can this alert run when it doesn't show in dom. I'm appending code with jquery.html()</p> <p>I know its not easy to understand my problem, but i hope someone will</p>

9471576	0	Extract first word in a SQLite3 database <p>I have a SQLITE3 database wherein I have stored various columns. One column (cmd) in particular contains the full command line and associated parameters. Is there a way to extract just the first word in this column (just before the first space)? I am not interested in seeing the various parameters used, but do want to see the command issued.</p> <p>Here's an example:</p> <p>select cmd from log2 limit 3;</p> <pre><code> user-sync //depot/PATH/interface.h user-info user-changes -s submitted //depot/PATH/build/...@2011/12/06:18:31:10,@2012/01/18:00:05:55 </code></pre> <p>From the result above, I'd like to use an inline SQL function (if available in SQLITE3) to parse on the first instance of space, and perhaps use a left function call (I know this is not available in SQLITE3) to return just the "user-sync" string. Same for "user-info" and "user-changes".</p> <p>Any ideas?</p> <p>Thanks.</p>

20134891	0	SKPhysicsBody bodyWithPolygonFromPath memory leaks <p>I have a strange memory leaks when creating Sprite Kit physics bodies with custom shapes. This is how my implementation looks:</p> <pre><code>CGFloat offsetX = self.frame.size.width * self.anchorPoint.x; CGFloat offsetY = self.frame.size.height * self.anchorPoint.y; CGMutablePathRef path = CGPathCreateMutable(); CGPathMoveToPoint(path, NULL, 4 - offsetX, 3 - offsetY); CGPathAddLineToPoint(path, NULL, 66 - offsetX, 3 - offsetY); CGPathAddLineToPoint(path, NULL, 35 - offsetX, 57 - offsetY); CGPathCloseSubpath(path); self.physicsBody = [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithPolygonFromPath:path]; CGPathRelease(path); </code></pre> <p>Everything is going on inside <code>SKSpriteNode</code> method. Instruments tells me about several memory leaks after creating such bodies:</p> <pre><code>Leaked object: Malloc 32 Bytes Size: 32 Bytes Responsible Library: PhysicsKit Responsible Frame: std::__1::__split_buffer&lt;PKPoint, std::__1::allocator&lt;PKPoint&gt;&amp;&gt;::__split_buffer(unsigned long, unsigned long, std::__1::allocator&lt;PKPoint&gt;&amp;) </code></pre> <p>The <code>CGPathRelease(path);</code> line is necessary - without it I'm getting more memory leaks about <code>CGPath</code> which is understandable. When I'm using this implementation instead (for testing purposes):</p> <pre><code>CGFloat radius = MAX(self.frame.size.width, self.frame.size.height) * 0.5f; self.physicsBody = [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithCircleOfRadius:radius]; </code></pre> <p>...everything is working well, without memory leaks. I wonder if this is Sprite Kit bug or I'm doing something wrong.</p>
1797502	0	Is there a scala identity function? <p>If I have something like a <code>List[Option[A]]</code> and I want to convert this into a <code>List[A]</code>, the standard way is to use <code>flatMap</code>:</p> <pre><code>scala&gt; val l = List(Some("Hello"), None, Some("World")) l: List[Option[java.lang.String]] = List(Some(Hello), None, Some(World)) scala&gt; l.flatMap( o =&gt; o) res0: List[java.lang.String] = List(Hello, World) </code></pre> <p>Now <code>o =&gt; o</code> is just an identity function.

I have to migrate these services to pivotal cloud foundry. Is it sufficient if I externalize the connection parameters potentially using cloud config server or env variables to connect to these databases or is there anything additional that I need to do? I assume any db which works with a java application deployed outside cloud foundry will work when the app is deployed to pivotal cloud foundry. Please correct me if my assumption is incorrect.</p>

897206	1	Python cgi FieldStorage slow, alternatives? <p>I have a python cgi script that receives files uploaded via a http post. The files can be large (300+ Mb). The thing is, cgi.FieldStorage() is incredibly slow for getting the file (a 300Mb file took 6 minutes to be "received"). Doing the same by just reading the stdin took around 15 seconds. The problem with the latter is, i would have to parse the data myself if there are multiple fields that are posted.</p> <p>Are there any faster alternatives to FieldStorage()?</p>

40541157	0	How to test channel with Phoenix.ChannelTest.close/2 <p>I have a test that starts up a socket connection and subscribes and joins a topic. I then push a message to the channel which does some work and persist some data. I then use ChannelTest.close/2 on the socket which simulates the client closing the connection. I would then like to modify the manipulated data and create another socket connection to test some behaviour.</p> <p>My issue is ChannelTest.close/2 causes my test to fail and returns <code>** (EXIT from #PID&lt;0.558.0&gt;) shutdown: :closed</code>. How can I prevent this from happening?</p> <p>Here's some relevant code</p> <pre><code>defmodule PlexServer.EmpireChannelTest do use PlexServer.ChannelCase alias PlexServer.EmpireChannel alias PlexServer.EmpireTemplate alias PlexServer.EmpireInstance setup do ... {:ok, _, socket} = socket("user_id", %{}) |&gt; subscribe_and_join(EmpireChannel, "empire:#{empire.id}", %{"guardian_token" =&gt; jwt}) {:ok, socket: socket, empire: empire, jwt: jwt} end test "research infrastructure", %{socket: socket, empire: empire, jwt: jwt} do ... ref = push socket, "command", request assert_reply ref, :ok, _, 1000 close(socket) #fails here ... end end defmodule PlexServer.UserSocket do use Phoenix.Socket use Guardian.Phoenix.Socket ## Channels # channel "rooms:*", PlexServer.RoomChannel channel "empire:*", PlexServer.EmpireChannel channel "user:*", PlexServer.UserChannel ## Transports transport :websocket, Phoenix.Transports.WebSocket def connect(_params,_) do :error end def id(_socket), do: nil end defmodule PlexServer.EmpireChannel do use PlexServer.Web, :channel use Guardian.Channel alias PlexServer.EmpireInstance alias PlexServer.EmpireServer ... def join("empire:" &lt;&gt; empire_id, %{claims: _claims, resource: user}, socket) do ... #Starts a process through a supervisor here end def join("empire:" &lt;&gt; _, _, _socket) do {:error, data_error(:auth, "not authorized, did you pass your jwt?")} end # Channels can be used in a request/response fashion # by sending replies to requests from the client def handle_in("ping", payload, socket) do {:reply, {:ok, payload}, socket} end def handle_in("show", _, socket) do ... end def handle_in("command", request, socket) do ... end def handle_in("remove", _, socket) do ... end def handle_in("ship_templates", _, socket) do ... end end </code></pre> <p>Following the answer linked in the comments I added some code:</p> <pre><code>Process.flag(:trap_exit, true) monitor_ref = Process.monitor(socket.channel_pid) close(socket) </code></pre> <p>Now I get a different error message: <code>** (exit) exited in: GenServer.call(PlexServer.EmpireSupervisor, {:terminate_child, :empire4}, :infinity) ** (EXIT) no process</code></p>

16047252	0	Identifying What Javascript is Running on a <span> through Chrome Inspector or Firebug <p>I am working on a site that has info being generated dynamically into <code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> tags through jQuery. The span has a class of "Price" and an id of a Product Code and it's being generated from a JSON data sheet according to the ID. The problem is, this is part of a much bigger framework and I can't seem to find where the Javascript is that's accomplishing this so I can troubleshoot it.</p> <p>I'm trying to figure out how to find that out using Google Chrome Inspector or Firebug. I'm assuming the page records this info when it's loaded but I can't seem to find where that info would lie. I know this may be pretty basic but I new to the Inspectors beyond just reading the HTML and CSS. Thanks for your help!</p>

Okay so I am happy with that. The next question however confuses me. How can I read the last line of an empty file? Better yet how do I continuously do this?

23996375	0	Can't resolve a Locale <p>I have a problem with Locale's. I'm trying to do a simple thing where I can choose english or german. So I have two property files called messages_en and messages_de. So far these files have a single line:</p> <pre><code> contactbook = Contact Book </code></pre> <p>and </p> <pre><code> contactbook = Adressbuch </code></pre> <p>respectively. </p> <p>Now in my JSP view I have this :</p> <pre><code> &lt;spring:message code="contactbook"/&gt; </code></pre> <p>The idea is that the message in the view changes depending on which locale we're using. Now the locale itself should be changed with this line:</p> <pre><code> &lt;a href="?language=en"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href="?language=de"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre> <p>If I remove the everything works great but of course it's not locale specified. So the rest of the view is good.</p> <p>In my dispatcher-servlet.xml file I have this:</p> <p> </p> <pre><code>&lt;bean id="localeResolver" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.i18n.SessionLocaleResolver"&gt; &lt;property name="defaultLocale" value="en" /&gt; &lt;/bean&gt; &lt;bean id="localeChangeInterceptor" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.i18n.LocaleChangeInterceptor"&gt; &lt;property name="paramName" value="language" /&gt; &lt;/bean&gt; &lt;bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.support.ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping" &gt; &lt;property name="interceptors"&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;ref bean="localeChangeInterceptor" /&gt; &lt;/list&gt; &lt;/property&gt; &lt;/bean&gt; </code></pre> <p>Again, without it everything works well. There's something wrong with my understanding here. The localeChangeInterceptor stops any change done to the locale and the ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping does what? I keep on looking at my controller and wondering should I add something to it but it seems to me that all these lines in the dispatcher should be enough.</p> <p>The exception I get is </p> <pre><code> No message found under code 'contactbook' for locale 'en' </code></pre> <p>Despite a myriad of examples out there I keep on failing to understand or resolve the problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

So as I usually do with WPF I went into the XAML and Typed my event name in the XAML and let VS create the event in code for me. </p> <pre><code>&lt;GridView x:Name="DataGrid1" ItemClick="dg_ItemClick"&gt; &lt;!-- Just --&gt; &lt;!-- Some --&gt; &lt;!-- Normal --&gt; &lt;!-- XAML --&gt; &lt;/GridView&gt; </code></pre> <p>and the VS created event looks like this</p> <pre><code> private void dg_ItemClick(object sender, Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ItemClickEventArgs e) { Biz.Customer cust = e.ClickedItem as Biz.Customer; var messageDialog2 = new MessageDialog(cust.Code, cust.Company); messageDialog2.ShowAsync(); } </code></pre> <p>Right away I get a red squiggly line under the UI in the Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls part. There is a using at the top of the page to include that and VS wouldn't let add any other UWP references. </p> <p>I can get the error to go away as I have in other parts of the application by changing the ItemClickEventArgs to RoutedEvenArgs but in this case I really need the ClickedItem as an argument to be passed to the code behind. </p> <p>I have just talked to someone else getting started with UWP and they said they are having the same issue on other cLick events. So are we both doing something wrong or is there something missing from our application that is needed for the UI to be recognized?</p> <p>The full error I am getting is this: Error CS0234 The type or namespace name 'UI' does not exist in the namespace 'app name' (are you missing an assembly reference?)</p>

Since there are many files, a For-Each Container is being used. However, before inserting it into a table, I want to look at the date fields and compare it to a date variable. If the dates match the variable, then move on to the step of the flow. But if any of the dates don't match the variable, then that file and its contents are discarded and the next file is looked at. </p> <p>How do I accomplish this in SSIS?</p>

12178205	0	Grouping objecs in PostgreSQL database <p>I inherited a project with a large Postgres database (over 150 tables, over 200 custom types, almost 1000 functions, triggers, etc.) Unfortunately, everything is dumped into one schema (<code>public</code>). It works just fine from the point of view of the application, however it's a major nightmare to maintain.</p> <p>The obvious thing would be to split these objects into separate schemas by function (e.g. all supplier-related stuff goes into <code>supplier</code> schema, all admin related stuff into <code>admin</code> schema, etc.). Once this is done, of course, some changes (ok, a lot of changes) to the code would be required to refer to the new schemas. Considering that the web application contains about 2000 php files, it may be quite a task. Again, as every php in the system already starts with <code>require_once('controller/config.php');</code> I could add a call there to set search path to include all the new schemas: <code>SET search_path = 'public, supplier, admin, ...'</code>, yet somehow subconsciously I don't like this solution.</p> <p>Is there any other way to deal with issue? I don't want to spend more effort than absolutely necessary on reorganising the database. I also can barely incur any downtime on the main web site, as it's used by clients across the world (Australia, Europe, North America).</p> <p>What would your recommend I do? </p>

16534013	0	Using Db::getInstance() in a CLI script <p>I've been wanting to create a add-on cron script that utilises Prestashop's DB class instead of instantiating the database handle directly, but I can't seem to figure out where did the "Db" class commonly referenced by "Db::getInstance()" calls get defined.</p> <p>classes/Db.php defines an abstract DbCore class. MySQLCore extends Db as you can see, however Db is never defined anywhere:</p> <pre><code>[/home/xxxx/www/shop/classes]# grep -r "extends Db" ../ ../classes/MySQL.php:class MySQLCore extends Db </code></pre> <p>According to another thread on Prestashop forums, the abstract DbCore class is implemented in a class located in override/classes/db, however that directory does not exist.</p> <pre><code>[/home/xxxx/www/shop/override]# cd ../override/ [/home/xxxx/www/shop/override]# ls ./ ../ classes/ controllers/ [/home/xxxx/www/shop/override]# cd classes/ [/home/xxxx/www/shop/override/classes]# ls ./ ../ _FrontController.php* _Module.php* _MySQL.php* </code></pre> <p>Our shop is working, so obviously I am missing something. We are running Prestashop 1.4.1, so perhaps the docs are no longer applicable.</p> <p>Quite clearly in many places in the code base functions from the Db class are being used, but this last grep through the code found nothing:</p> <pre><code>grep -rwI "Db" . | grep -v "::" ./modules/productcomments/productcommentscriterion.php:require_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/../../classes/Db.php'); ./classes/MySQL.php:class MySQLCore extends Db ./classes/Db.php: * Get Db object instance (Singleton) ./classes/Db.php: * @return object Db instance ./classes/Db.php: * Build a Db object </code></pre> <p>Is there something I am missing?

These are epic pieces of information to have!</p> <p>I was able to infer that the variable <code>__FUNCTION__</code> will give you the function name that you are inside of... amazing!!

5126721	0	Rails not reloading session on ajax post <p>I'm experiencing a very strange problem with Rails and ajax using jQuery (although I don't think it's specific to jQuery).</p> <p>My Rails application uses the cookie session store, and I have a very simple login that sets the user id in the session. If the user_id isn't set in the session, it redirects to a login page. This works with no problems. JQuery GET requests work fine too. The problem is when I do a jQuery POST - the browser sends the session cookie ok (I confirmed this with Firebug and dumping request.cookies to the log) but the session is blank, i.e. session is {}.</p> <p>I'm doing this in my application.js:</p> <pre><code>$(document).ajaxSend(function(e, xhr, options) { var token = $("meta[name='csrf-token']").attr('content'); xhr.setRequestHeader('X-CSRF-Token', token); }); </code></pre> <p>and here is my sample post:</p> <pre><code>$.post('/test/1', { _method: 'delete' }, null, 'json'); </code></pre> <p>which should get to this controller method (_method: delete):</p> <pre><code>def destroy respond_to do |format| format.json { render :json =&gt; { :destroyed =&gt; 'ok' }.to_json } end end </code></pre> <p>Looking at the log and using Firebug I can confirm that the correct cookie value is sent in the request header when the ajax post occurs, but it seems that at some point Rails loses this value and therefore loses the session, so it redirects to the login page and never gets to the method.</p> <p>I've tried everything I can think of to debug this but I'm coming around to the idea that this might be a bug in Rails. I'm using Rails 3.0.4 and jQuery 1.5 if that helps. I find it very strange that regular (i.e. non-ajax) get and post requests work, and ajax get requests work with no problems, it's just the ajax posts that don't.</p> <p>Any help in trying to fix this would be greatly appreciated!</p> <p>Many thanks,<br> Dave</p>

23273433	0	javascript/jquery ignore or override :hover style <p><strong>Short Description:</strong> I want to use JS/JQuery to take precedence over the CSS :hover psuedo-class for specific brief moments without removing the CSS rule for the other <em>majority</em> of cases. Since the site is already script-heavy enough I'm trying to find a solution that doesn't require me to nuke the CSS interaction and rely on mouseover/mouseout events. In my case there's a marked performance difference between the two.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> I've created a CSS-based dropdown shopping cart viewer. I rigged up some JQuery to force the cart open when the user triggers certain page interactions like adding an item to the cart. When the cart is "programmatically opened" an 8 second timer is used to close it. All that works. <strong>The Problem:</strong> I also want to add a click handler to the cart so that when the user clicks on it it will be explicitly closed whether the 8second timeout has expired or not. However, when they click on the cart they are - by definition - hovering over it, kicking in the :hover state and keeping it from closing. Is there a way to temporarily disable the :hover rule and then once the cart has closed reinstate it.</p> <p><strong>HTML:</strong></p> <pre><code>&lt;span class="minicart-wrapper"&gt; &lt;a class="minicart-anchor" href="..."&gt;Shopping Cart&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div id="minicart"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/span&gt; </code></pre> <p><strong>CSS:</strong></p> <pre><code>.minicart-wrapper #minicart { display: none; } .minicart-wrapper:hover #minicart, .minicart-wrapper #minicart.open { display: block; } </code></pre> <p><strong>JQuery:</strong></p> <pre><code>function openMinicart() { var minicart = jQuery('#minicart'); minicart.addClass('open'); minicart.bind('click', {}, closeMinicart); window.setTimeout(closeMinicart, 8000); } function closeMinicart() { var minicart = jQuery('#minicart'); minicart.removeClass('open'); minicart.unbind('click', closeMinicart); } </code></pre> <p><strike><strong>I've tried:</strong> a few suggestions I found here like changing <code>.minicart-wrapper:hover #minicart</code> to <code>.minicart-wrapper:hover #minicart.canhover</code>. I then added <code>removeClass(canhover)</code> to the beginning of closeMinicart() and <code>setTimeout(function(){jQuery('#minicart').addClass('canhover')},500);</code> to the end of it. However it seems that this is too short a timeout for the browser to refresh it's hover-state and before it's done rendering the hover re-triggers and the cart stays put.</strike></p> <p>Thanks for any suggestions.</p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thanks Jedison. Here's the JSFiddle: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/WJS3h/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/WJS3h/</a> . Also fixed some bugs in the sample.</p> <p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Turns out I had a code error (oops) and the can-not-hover class method is the way to go. Thanks to everyone who commented.</p>

Here are the load times of a few pages: <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nzmy3.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/V4brS.png"> (the 6.9 minutes was when I tried loading 7 tabs with different pages)</p> <p>This problem does not occur when I'm using the Azure emulator, locally. </p> <p>I've tried using an extra large instance, and using remote desktop to run the site locally, and it was just as slow. Also I have tried using IIS Express and normal IIS, and nothing there either.</p> <p>I created a completely fresh MVC project using the "Internet application" template, which includes security, and it is very slow as well, so I'm pretty sure the other things I'm using in my project are not causing the problem. Here are the load times with just the default MVC project: <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YUd25.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>I was originally using separate affinity regions for my membership DB and my website, but I've tried using matching affinity groups on both the blank MVC template with forms authentication and my project.</p> <p>Revisiting pages doesn't improve their speed significantly.</p> <p>I also tried creating just a MVC site without authentication, with a 10x5000 table generated:</p> <pre><code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; @for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { &lt;th&gt;@i &lt;/th&gt; } &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; @for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5000; i++) { &lt;tr&gt; @for(int j = 0; j &lt; 10; j++) { &lt;td&gt;Row @i , column @j&lt;/td&gt; } &lt;/tr&gt; } &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre> <p>This loads fine, both locally and on the cloud. Even from a cold start it is only ~10-15 seconds.</p> <p>So I'm fairly certain that the issue lies in the Profile/Membership/Authentication of ASP.NET, but only while it is deployed to Azure (since I'm using the same SQL Azure database with Universal Providers when running locally, and there aren't these slowdowns).</p> <p>I expected this problem to be more common, but the only thing that really seemed relevant was this: <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsazuremanagement/thread/7d3323d8-571b-4b8f-9fdb-bd5ccc6c39b7" rel="nofollow noreferrer">social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsazuremanagement/thread/7d3323d8-571b-4b8f-9fdb-bd5ccc6c39b7</a> (possibly this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10791433/saving-changes-very-slow-via-datacontext">stackoverflow.com/questions/10791433/saving-changes-very-slow-via-datacontext</a>)</p> <p>I'm working through the things to try, as suggested in that thread, at: <a href="http://windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/windows/best-practices/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/windows/best-practices/</a></p>

So apologies if I make a mistake...</p> <p>The challenge: I have a website (main.com), a sub-domain (sub.main.com) and 10 websites that send traffic, back and forth, to the main site and the sub domain. Let's call these sites site01.com, site02.com, site03.com,...,site10.com.</p> <p>My question: How do I implement Universal Tag so I can do cross-domain tracking between main.com, sub.main.com and site01.com, site02.com, site03.com,...,site10.com.</p> <p>I found instructions on how to do cross domain tracking for two sites. For example, on the main domain I will add the following code:</p> <pre><code>**&lt;!-- Universal Analytics --&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'main.com', {'allowLinker': true}); ga('require', 'linker'); ga('linker:autoLink', ['site01.com']); ga('send', 'pageview'); &lt;/script&gt;** </code></pre> <p>And on site01.com, I will add the code below:</p> <pre><code>**&lt;!-- Universal Analytics --&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X', 'site01.com',{'allowLinker': true}); ga('send', 'pageview'); &lt;/script&gt;** </code></pre> <p>I don't know how to modify the code to include all 10 sites (site01.com, site02.com, site03.com,...,site10.com as part of the cross domain tracking.</p> <p>Also, in relation to sub-domain tracking, I am guessing that the above code will also capture data from the sub-domain site (sub.main.com) with no issues.</p> <p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p> <p>Stratos.</p>

4760995	0	Get change commands without modifying collection <p>Probably a very poorly named title, but anyway...</p> <p>I am using the command pattern on a hierarchical data set. So basically I need a method that returns an object that <em>describes</em> the changes that will be made without actually changing the data. So for example:</p> <p>Object 1 -> Object 2 -> Object 3</p> <p>If I move object 1, it will cause a change in Object 2, which will cause a change in Object 3 because they depend on each other. So...I need a method to recursively go through the hierarchical collection and gather up the changes that are required to move Object 1 without actually modifying the collection. Halfway through the recursion it would be nice to be able to use something like Object1.Location, but it may already slated for change so I can't reliably use it.</p> <p>I feel like there are plenty of algorithms and such that need to do this type of "in place" modification. As a non-CS major I didn't learn much of this type of thing, so I don't really even know what search terms to look for to find a "solution". I put solution in quotes because I realize there probably isn't a direct solution for my problem, but I am merely looking for some good guidelines/examples of this being done to get my brain cranking.</p> <p>Can anyone provide some real-world examples of this type of thing being done? Thanks in advance.</p>

5833218	1	CoreDumpDirectory isn't working on ubuntu; getting segmentation fault in apache2 error log <p>I am not able to log the apache2 crashes in CoreDumpDirectory on ubuntu 10.10. I am using Django 1.2.3 and apache2 with mod_wsgi. I followed the steps listed in response to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2534531/coredumpdirectory-isnt-working-on-ubuntu-getting-segmentation-fault-with-php">this</a> question but to no avail. I added - <code>CoreDumpDirectory /var/cache/apache2/</code><br> at the end of apache2.conf file and then after executing <code>'ulimit -c unlimited'</code>, restarted the apache server. Then I replicated the condition that causes apache error log to show- "<code>child pid 27288 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)</code>" but there is no mention of apache2 logging that crash in CoreDumpDirectory and also there is nothing in /var/cache/apache2.</p> <p>EDIT:</p> <p>I was able to solve this problem. The issue was with PyLucene environment being initialized on the run time. I was executing initvm() call everytime a request comes and it was causing segmentation fault. <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-pylucene-dev/201008.mbox/%3CAANLkTin0sDK1nkMWUouOX2r9_3Voo=jqtoNds+dimd4W@mail.gmail.com%3E" rel="nofollow">This link</a> directed that I should do it in .wsgi file and after I did that there were no segmentation faults.</p>

So in order to fix that I need to add in <code>/*Shift up*/</code> two lines which should work as</p> <pre><code>document.getElementById(i+1).addEventListener('click', helper(i+1) ); document.getElementById(i+1).removeEventListener('click', helper(i) ); </code></pre> <p>Clearly It will not work. Due to recursive nature of <code>create_button</code> function, I imagine that <code>helper</code> should be moved outside of <code>create_button</code>. But I have no idea how to do it.</p> <p><strong>Some additional info</strong> I simplified the code, but in practice buttons have some addition functions which depend on n. Let say that we also want to alert the position of the button. So we change helper to</p> <pre><code>function helper() { create_button(n+1); alert(n+1); }; </code></pre> <p>See in <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/o3Lsttyq/3/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/o3Lsttyq/3/</a> what alerts say.

My <code>Message</code> class holds both a image and a video. Now I am about to implement the video file transfer (image already implemented, and is working).

Instead it refreshes the page (ie. I think it simply posts the form to user_agreement4.php and does nothing else) When JavaScript is disabled and I click on the YES radio button and submit it, the message “YES status checked” displays correctly. Please note that the code below is for user_agreement4.php. The form will be submitted to itself.</p> <p>What am I doing wrong?</p> <p>Please note that this is unfinished code-I haven't added things like cookies, redirection etc. yet.</p> <p>Also I have a question about choosing answers.

I have a button on the stage named fortyfivedown_btn, and a healthbar, which is a 101 frame (includes zero) movieclip. The health bar has an instance name of lifebar. On the stage, the button coding is:</p> <pre><code>fortyfivedown_btn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, fortyfivedownClick); function fortyfivedownClick(event:MouseEvent):void{ lifebar.health = lifebar.health-45; } </code></pre> <p>Inside the healthbar movieclip, I have a layer of coding that is:</p> <pre><code>var health:int = 100; gotoAndStop(health + 1); if(health &lt; 0) health = 0; else if(health &gt; 100) health = 100; gotoAndStop(health + 1); </code></pre> <p>So, there is my coding. The thing is, when the button is clicked, the healthbar does not go down. I traced the health variable in the button:</p> <pre><code> fortyfivedown_btn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, fortyfivedownClick); function fortyfivedownClick(event:MouseEvent):void{ lifebar.health = lifebar.health-45; } { trace(lifebar.health); } </code></pre> <p>I saw that the output is 0. For some reason the button believes the health is 0, when I declared it was 100 inside the healthbar movieclip? Any help is appreciated.</p> <p>(Edit)</p> <p>Alright, in answer to the trace question, if I don't do it like that, there is no output.

17935283	0	How to get all the parent classes of a derived class in C# Reflection <p>It is weird that I was not able to find a similar question but this is what actually I want, finding all the parent classes of a derived class. </p> <p>I tested a code with a hope that it works for me :</p> <pre><code>void WriteInterfaces() { var derivedClass = new DerivedClass(); var type = derivedClass.GetType(); var interfaces = type.FindInterfaces((objectType, criteria) =&gt; objectType.Name == criteria.ToString(),"BaseClass"); foreach(var face in interfaces) { face.Name.Dump(); } } interface BaseInterface {} class BaseClass : BaseInterface {} class BaseClass2 : BaseClass {} class DerivedClass : BaseClass2{} </code></pre> <p>Basically, here my main intention is to check if a derived class somehow inherits a base class somewhere in its base hierarchy.</p> <p>However, this code returns null and works only with interfaces.</p>

40310595	1	How to not block making initial connection with python requests? <p>I have a server that uses requests to make queries to another server that may or may not be running. If that server is not running, I do not want to block for a long time; I can just handle the error right away. However, the timeout parameter does not seem to apply to the process of making the initial connection.</p> <p>From the terminal, I run:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import time &gt;&gt;&gt; import requests &gt;&gt;&gt; t1 = time.time() ; exec("try: requests.get('http://192.168.99.100/', timeout=1.0)\nexcept: pass") ; t2 = time.time() ; t2 - t1 21.00611114501953 </code></pre> <p>This takes about 21 seconds and has no dependance on the timeout I give. I also tried using eventlet's timeout, but it turned out the same:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import time &gt;&gt;&gt; import eventlet &gt;&gt;&gt; requests = eventlet.import_patched('requests') &gt;&gt;&gt; t1 = time.time() ; exec("try: \n with eventlet.Timeout(1): requests.get('http://192.168.99.100/')\nexcept: pass") ; t2 = time.time() ; t2 - t1 21.00276017189026 </code></pre> <p>The error I am getting for the connection is:</p> <pre><code>ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', error(11, 'Resource temporarily unavailable')) </code></pre> <p>Finally, I am running python under the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which might be working with sockets differently.</p>

Concerning thread-safety etc.</p> <p>EDIT</p> <p>Ok, I try to be more specific. I mean the bad source code lines, where I will have forgotten or failed to make sure, that they won't be an (concurrency) issue.</p> <p>So, maybe the 1-core htt "lies" by preventing dead-locks, crashes, cpu spikes or anything that my code causes on a 2-core machine. I'm unsure, how exactly 2 (logical) processors of a htt PC are different from 2 processors of a dual-core PC, how transparent htt is. If there's any issue, I'll probably buy a second PC just for that, that's why I asked.</p>

The next step for me is to create a native ios app using Phonegap. </p> <p>My guess is all I have to do is in the html page which I put in Phonegap, I will hook into page load event and dynamically load the contents of my MVC view from a remote server.</p> <p>But I am looking for some examples if anyone else has done something similar.</p> <p>-Thanks in advance Nick</p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I was able to accomplish this by writing the following index.html page.

29423834	0	How to apply JSON data to an EmberJS Model Attribute <p>I'm very new to JS and I'm retrying EmberJS due to the impending 2.0 but especially because of EMBER CLI which I really like the structure.</p> <p>Anyways, I'm building a basic app and what I'm currently looking to do is make a JSON call to reddit to grab the subscriber number and apply that number to a models subscriber number attribute. I'll also be cycling through an array of models too.</p> <p>So for my instance, I've got models of lets say sports teams. Each team as a subreddit and when someone clicks the league they want, I'll be displaying all of the teams in that league.</p> <p>I've got the the JSON working from a pure JS aspect, and I've got the Ember app working w/o any JSON. So I'm just trying to figure out how to connect the two while also realizing I will probably need to do some tear down to properly connect the two.</p> <p>So my question is, how do I go about selecting a single piece of data from Reddit API to a single model attribute?</p> <p>Here is the JS I'm using currently to pull the subscriber number.</p> <pre><code>$.each( teamList, function( key, val ) { $.getJSON( "http://api.reddit.com/r/"+val+"/about", function foo(data) { $("#team").append(val + " : "); $("#team").append(data.data.subscribers + '&lt;br&gt;'); } ); }); </code></pre> <p>My current ember model setup is normal, but I am using fixtures since all data is static other than this model attribute.</p>

The datatable has input fields where user can put text. As simple as that, a pretty common case.</p> <p>With session-scoped bean this no issue, as the same bean is updated over and over again. However, I want to do this in request scope. For each request, I guess I want to create a new bean and to populate it with the values from my form. Then I want my <code>commandButton</code>'s <code>action</code> to add a new row, finally render the <code>dataTable</code> over AJAX as usual.</p> <p>The issue is that I don't know how to make JSF fill the newly-created request-bean with the current data from the dataTable component?</p> <p>There was <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2278353/how-to-dynamically-add-a-row-in-a-table-in-jsf">a similar question</a> asked and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2278353/how-to-dynamically-add-a-row-in-a-table-in-jsf/2280157#2280157">answered</a>. However, that solution seems to reload the contents of the dataTable each time it is refreshed and manually inserts empty elements for the newly-inserted rows like this:</p> <pre><code>// Preserve list with newly added items. ror (int i = 0; i &lt; (Integer) count.getValue(); i++) { list.add(new Item()); } </code></pre> <p>To me, it seems that this approach also wipes the possible changes that the user did to rows (new and old)... if he doesn't first save them.</p> <p>Any pointers?</p>

But all rows of the same group need to be on the same page (but not one page per group and it doesn't matter how many rows actually are on one page - just not too many). I don't see this done with a LIMIT statement, so I started to write my own:</p> <pre><code>SET @grp := 0, @last_lat := '', @last_lng := ''; SELECT * FROM ( SELECT v.*, @grp := IF((@last_lat = lat) &amp;&amp; (@last_lng = lng), @grp, @grp + 1) AS grp, @last_lat := lat AS llat, @last_lng := lng AS llng FROM v INNER JOIN ( SELECT lat, lng FROM v GROUP BY lat, lng HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1 ) AS vg USING (lat, lng) ORDER BY lat, lng ) AS vv WHERE grp BETWEEN 0 AND 7 ORDER BY grp ; </code></pre> <p>This query whit out the WHERE part outputs this data:</p> <pre><code>ID LAT LNG L NAME GRP LLAT LLNG 1 12 12 a group1-1 6 12 12 2 12 12 b group1-2 6 12 12 5 13 13 e group2-2 7 13 13 6 13 13 f group2-3 7 13 13 4 13 13 d group2-1 7 13 13 7 10 13 g group3-1 8 10 13 8 10 13 h group3-2 8 10 13 10 11 12 h group4-2 9 11 12 9 11 12 h group4-1 9 11 12 13 10 14 j group5-3 10 10 14 11 10 14 i group5-1 10 10 14 12 10 14 j group5-2 10 10 14 </code></pre> <p>The idea is to change the values in the line WHERE grp BETWEEN 0 AND 7 for each page. But the numbers from the group don't start at 1 and I can't see why (and that makes it unusable for the first page). The Start number is different depending on how many group are in the whole data.

17145193	0	How to let a specific android device (fonepad) use different layout folder <p>I'm working on an Android app that has different layouts for phones (designed for portrait) and for tablets (designed for landscape).</p> <p>Now I want to support the Asus Fonepad as a phone but since it has the size and resolution of a 7 inch tablet it always uses the layouts in the layout-sw600dp folder. But the fonepad understands itself as a phone and shows the fullscreen text edit window whenever text input is used in landscape.</p> <p>How can I make this device use layouts and values from the phones and not from the -sw600dp folders? Is this even possible?</p>
12188339	0	Java write to Stdin <p>So I have imported a jruby interpreter as a library to run an external ruby application. However I need to interact with the ruby application in some way. Right now I have the ruby application outputting information on stdout and requesting user options in stdin.</p> <p>So if I want java to be able to handle inserting the options instead of a user, I'll need a way that I can write to the stdin somehow from java to choose the options. Does anyone know how I can do this? Or even a better way to do this?</p> <p>I'm calling jruby like so:</p> <pre><code>String[] newargs = new String[2]; newargs[0] = "-S"; newargs[1] = "path_to_some_rubyfile.rb" org.jruby.Main jruby = new org.jruby.Main(); ruby.main(newargs); </code></pre> <p>The ruby app outputs stuff like this:</p> <pre><code>How do you feel today? (1) Happy (2) Sad </code></pre> <p>And then waits for the user input to enter 1 or 2. But I would like Java to input these options instead of having a user do it.</p>

My problem is that I can't programatically change it's size.

My monitor's resolution is 1280x768 and is widescreen. The problem is while it appears properly in my screen it doesn't appear properly in others. Which is the best approach to solve the problem ? </p> <p>I have 2 in mind. </p> <blockquote> <ol> <li>Let scrollbars take care of it : If the screen is 14 inch screen with 800x600 resolution it appears zoomed in. So thats a problem</li> <li>Get screen resolution and resize using scaleX and scaleY : The graphic components will get resized but fonts give problem.</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>Which is the best approach among these ?

2557207	0	Selectively replacing words outside of tags using regular expressions in PHP? <p>I have a paragraph of text and i want to replace some words using PHP (preg_replace). Here's a sample piece of text:</p> <p><code>This lesson addresses rhyming [one]words and ways[/one] that students may learn to identify these words. Topics include learning that rhyming words sound alike and these sounds all come from the [two]ending of the words[/two]. This can be accomplished by having students repeat sets of rhyming words so that they can say them and hear them. The students will also participate in a variety of rhyming word activities. In order to demonstrate mastery the students will listen to [three]sets of words[/three] and tell the teacher if the words rhyme or not.</code></p> <p>If you notice there are many occurances of the word 'words'. I want to replace all the occurances that <strong>don't</strong> occur inside any of the tags with the word 'birds'.

The format of my key looks something like this (as per my namespace convention)</p> <pre><code>"resque:lock:Jobs::XYZ::SomeCreator-{:my_ids=&gt;[101]}" </code></pre> <p>The job runs successfully to completition. But the key still exists in redis. For a certain flow, i need to queue and execute the job again for the same parameters (the key will essentially be same). But seems like the job does not get queued.</p> <p>My guess is that since the key already exists in Redis, it does not queue the job again.</p> <p>Questions:</p> <p>Is this behavior of resque normal (not removing the key after successful completition)?</p> <p>If Yes, how should i tackle this scenario (as per best practices)?</p> <p>If No, can you help me understand what is going wrong?</p>

38534312	0	In Firebase 3.0 together with Angularjs, it seems onAuthStateChanged fires on every route change. Is that expected? <p>I have an app using Firebase and Angularjs. If I put a listener on onAuthStateChanged, it seems to fire every time I navigate to a new url in my site, and the Angularjs Route changes. This seems undesirable/incorrect? Anyone else experience this? E.g. if I do this in a controller:</p> <pre><code> firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(function(user) { if (user) { alert("changed"); } }); </code></pre> <p>every time the route changes the alert pops up. </p> <p>Since the logged in state of the user doesn't seem to be changing, why would this listener fire? I think I am missing something. Anyone understand what's going on?</p>

I've been tasked with normalizing and inserting this data into our data model. </p> <p>I would like to create a query that used a grouping of, for example "customer_number", and returned a result set that only contains the columns that are non distinct for each customer_number. I don't know if it's even possible, but it would be of great help if it was.</p> <p>Edit:if my table has 3 columns(cust_num,cust_name_cust_address) and 5 records</p> <pre><code>|cust_num|cust_name|cust_address |01 |abc |12 1st street |02 |cbs |1 Aroundthe Way |01 |abc |MLK BLVD |03 |DMC |Hollis Queens |02 |cbs |1 Aroundthe Way </code></pre> <p>the results from my desired query should just be the data from cust_num and cust_name because cust_address has different values for that grouping of cust_num. A cust_num has many addresses but only one cust_name.</p> <p>Can someone point me in the right direction? </p> <p>Jim</p>

If not, how would you modify the EXIF script to also parse IPTC data?</p> <p><b>UPDATE</b></p> <p>I've modified the EXIF script I linked above. It <i>sorta</i> does what I want, but it's not grabbing the right data 100 percent of the time.</p> <p>After line 401, I added:</p> <pre><code>else if (iMarker == 237) { // 0xED = Application-specific 13 (Photoshop IPTC) if (bDebug) log("Found 0xFFED marker"); return readIPTCData(oFile, iOffset + 4, getShortAt(oFile, iOffset+2, true)-2); } </code></pre> <p>And then elsewhere in the script, I added this function:</p> <pre><code>function readIPTCData(oFile, iStart, iLength) { exif = new Array(); if (getStringAt(oFile, iStart, 9) != "Photoshop") { if (bDebug) log("Not valid Photoshop data! " + getStringAt(oFile, iStart, 9)); return false; } var output = ''; var count = 0; two = new Array(); for (i=0; i&lt;iLength; i++) { if (getByteAt(oFile, iStart + i) == 2 &amp;&amp; getByteAt(oFile, iStart + i + 1) == 120) { var caption = getString2At(oFile, iStart + i + 2, 800); } if (getByteAt(oFile, iStart + i) == 2 &amp;&amp; getByteAt(oFile, iStart + i + 1) == 80) { var credit = getString2At(oFile, iStart + i + 2, 300); } } exif['ImageDescription'] = caption; exif['Artist'] = credit; return exif; } </code></pre> <p>So let me now modify my question slightly. How can the function above be improved?</p>

Actually the program is designed to navigate recursively in the site and each step its waiting for a <code>WebBrowserDocumentCompletedEventHandler</code> to be triggered. Beside that there is a Form timer set, and if the handler is not triggered in a specific interval then its reloading the entire procedure.</p> <p>Everything is working good even if I manually avoid the handler from triggering - As I said the timer kicks in and restart the operation successfully and retrying another value successfully.</p> <p>When shutting the internet connection manually while the procedure is running, I can see the page is getting the internet explorer message: "This page can't be displayed" (For some reason the DocumentComplete... is not triggered). Then immediately reconnecting the internet and waiting for the timer to kick in - As expected it fires the reload function but this time everything is going wild!! the functions are being fired not in the correct order and it seems like there is 100 threads that are running at the same time - a total chaos.</p> <p>I know that its not easy to answer this question without experiencing that and seeing the code But if I copy the entire code it will be just too long using 5 different classes and I really can't see where is the problem... I'll try to simplify the question:</p> <ol> <li>why when connection lost the documentcomplete handler don't fires?</li> <li>Does anyone has experienced an application going wild only after webbrowser control losses connection?</li> </ol> <p>Thanks</p>

As such we build our object graph through Guice Modules.</p> <p>How do we provide/instruct Jackson to use our pre-built Guice Injector? Or it's own injector based on a Guice Module we provide? My preference is to provide it the injector because we already have means to control which module is used based on the environment/configuration we want to run in.</p> <p>Here's a unit test:</p> <pre><code>public class Building { @JsonIgnore public final ElectricalProvider electricalProvider; public String name; @Inject Building(ElectricalProvider electricalProvider){ this.electricalProvider = electricalProvider; } public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; } } public interface ElectricalProvider {} public class SolarElectricalProvider implements ElectricalProvider{} @Test public void testJacksonGuice() throws IOException { Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(new Module() { @Override public void configure(Binder binder) { binder.bind(ElectricalProvider.class).to(SolarElectricalProvider.class); } }); Building building1 = injector.getInstance(Building.class); building1.setName("test building"); ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper(); byte[] buildingJsonBytes = objectMapper.writeValueAsBytes(building1); Building building2 = objectMapper.readValue(buildingJsonBytes, Building.class); assertThat(building1, is(equalTo(building2))); assertThat(building2.electricalProvider, is(instanceOf(SolarElectricalProvider.class))); } </code></pre> <p>That when run generates this exception <code>com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException</code>, with this message: No suitable constructor found for type [simple type, class Building]: can not instantiate from JSON object (missing default constructor or creator, or perhaps need to add/enable type information?)</p> <p>After a bit of googling, I came across the <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-guice" rel="nofollow">jackson-module-guice</a> project but it doesn't appear to be what we need or doesn't provide as to how to accomplish what we need to do.</p>
31391581	0	How to bind multiple struct fields without getting "use moved value" error? <p>I'm trying to code a generic list as an exercise - I know it's already supported by the syntax, I'm just trying to see if I can code a recursive data structure. As it turns out, I can't. I'm hitting a wall when I want to access more than one field of an owned struct value.</p> <p>What I'm doing is basically this - I define a struct that will hold a list:</p> <pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>struct ListNode&lt;T&gt; { val: T, tail: List&lt;T&gt; } struct List&lt;T&gt;(Option&lt;Box&lt;ListNode&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;); </code></pre> <p>Empty list is just represented by <code>List(None)</code>.</p> <p>Now, I want to be able to append to a list:</p> <pre><code>impl&lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt; { fn append(self, val: T) -&gt; List&lt;T&gt; { match self { List(None) =&gt; List(Some(Box::new(ListNode { val: val, tail: List(None) }))), List(Some(node)) =&gt; List(Some(Box::new(ListNode { val: node.val, tail: node.tail.append(val) }))) } } } </code></pre> <p>Ok, so that fails with an error "used of moved value: node" at node.tail with an explanation that it was moved at "node.val". This is understandable.</p> <p>So, I look for ways to use more than one field of a struct and I find this: <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2014-January/008216.html">Avoiding partially moved values error when consuming a struct with multiple fields</a></p> <p>Great, so I'll do that:</p> <pre><code>List(Some(node)) =&gt; { let ListNode { val: nval, tail: ntail } = *node; List(Some(Box::new(ListNode { val: nval, tail: ntail.append(val) }))) } </code></pre> <p>Well, nope, still node is being moved at assignment ("error: use of moved value 'node'" at "tail: ntail"). Apparently this doesn't work like in the link anymore.</p> <p>I've also tried using refs:</p> <pre><code>List(Some(node)) =&gt; { let ListNode { val: ref nval, tail: ref ntail } = *node; List(Some(Box::new(ListNode { val: *nval, tail: (*ntail).append(val) }))) } </code></pre> <p>This time the deconstruction passes, but the creation of the new node fails with "error: cannot move out of borrowed content".</p> <p>Am I missing something obvious here? If not, what is the proper way to access multiple fields of a struct that is not passed by reference?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p> <p>EDIT: Oh, I should probably add that I'm using Rust 1.1 stable.</p>

The goal is to be able to fill in the amount of hours you've worked on a subject on certain day of the current week.</p> <p>So far, I'm able to add a new textbox whenever I press the button for the day I want to update the data for.

6191772	0	Calling C/C++ functions in dynamic and static libraries in D <p>I'm having trouble wrapping my head around how to interface with C/C++ libraries, both static (.lib/.a) and dynamic (.dll/.so), in D. From what I understand, it's possible to tell the DMD compiler to link with .lib files, and that you can convert .dll files to .lib with the implib tool that Digital Mars provides. In addition, I've come across <a href="http://digitalmars.com/d/2.0/htomodule.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, which implies being able to call functions in .dlls by converting C header files to D interface files. Are both of these methods equivalent? Would these same methods work for Unix library files? Also, how would one reference functions, enums, etc from these libraries, and how would one tell their D compiler to link with these libs (I'm using VisualD, specifically)? If anyone could provide some examples of referencing .lib, .dll, .a, and .so files from D code, I'd be most grateful. </p>

1861282	0	.net, UserControls, and application start time <p>We have a medium sized application that depends on several usercontrols, namely:</p> <p>A tablelayout panel, with 2x5 grid of usercontrols, with 3+ levels of inheritance. A big issue we're running into with our application has proven to be startup time (both cold\warm), one of the big big hangups we're getting is initializing this usercontrol grid.</p> <p>From our timing reports, this form comes in at about 0.75 seconds for initialization, and cutting this down would be a <em>big deal</em>.</p> <p>My question is: What the heck can I do to speed this up? Whenever I run timing checks on similar-complexity InitializeComponents (all windows, .net controls), the result is magnitudes less (&lt;10 milleseconds) sometimes. </p> <p>edit) I'm wondering if things like marking my final classes <em>sealed</em> or something similar would help.</p> <p>edit2) I've looked deeper into the timing of initializecomponent, and for my current machine, The main container adds 10 components to it (at 10ms a piece). Each of those components adds 3 components (at 10ms a piece). 10x10 + 30x10 = 700ms. Unless I can increase the speed at which items get added to their containers, I think I'm SOL.</p>
22589182	0	Set 'nice' value to concrete processes, by default <p>I would like to set specific "nice" values to several processes in a laptop. For example, I would like the window manager to run at -10, and keep the default at 0.</p> <p>I know that "renice" can change the niceness of a processes, but this is a-posteriori, and I do not want to "renice" my window manager process every time that I open the computer. Similarly, "limits.conf" allows to specify default niceness for specific users or groups, but not (as far as I know) specific processes.</p> <p>So my question is whether there is a way to define niceness for concrete processes, without having to change the default for the user and without having to renice the process once it runs.</p>

31193716	0	UITabBarController - transition from one tab's navigation stack to a view controller of another tab's navigation stack <p>Novice iOS developer here. I am making a simple tabbed chat application in Swift using a UITabBarController. For simplicity, let's assume the application only has two tabs, "Contacts" and "Chats". Each of the two tabs has a navigation controller. </p> <p>The "Chats" navigation stack begins with a UITableViewController called "ChatsTableViewController" which lists the user's chats. When the user selects a chat, the app segues to a MessagesViewController which displays the messages for the selected chat.</p> <p>The "Contacts" navigation stack includes a UITableViewController which lists the user's contacts. Upon selecting a contact, another view controller is presented modally, asking the user whether they would like to begin a chat with the selected contact, and giving them the option to cancel. If the user chooses to begin a chat, I would like to transition from this modal view controller to the MessagesViewController of the "Chats" tab, passing the information necessary to display the chat (which I have at the ready in the modal view controller).</p> <p>When the MessagesViewController loads, regardless of whether we get to it by selecting a chat from the "Chats" tab or by creating a new chat from the "Contacts" tab, it should have a navigation bar at the top with a "Back" button that takes the user to the ChatsTableViewController.</p> <p>I have done a good deal of searching, but have not found any solutions that fit what I need. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Here is a summary of what I am looking for.</p> <ol> <li>Standard way to perform a transition from a view controller in one tab's navigation stack to a view controller (that is not the root view controller in my case) of another tab's navigation stack, while passing relevant information to display in the destination view controller.</li> <li>The view controller I transition to should have a navigation bar with a back button that takes the user to the previous view controller in its navigation stack, just as if they had accessed it from the normal navigation flow of the tab.</li> </ol> <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I've found that you can easily switch tabs programmatically using <code>self.tabBarController?.selectedIndex = index_of_tab_to_switch_to</code>, however, this takes me to the first view of the tab and I am still unsure of how I can pass data. Any thoughts on how I can proceed? </p>

Then i created a branch B, from branch A.

Next step is to sync B with A:</p> <pre><code>~/branch_b$ svn merge ^/trunk </code></pre> <p>Here i get some tree conflicts, in files/dirs that already existed in trunk before the merge but were changed in the cherry-picks i did earlier (don't know if it has anything to do with it, i'm just mentioning it):</p> <pre><code> C some_dir/other_dir/some_file.php &gt; local add, incoming add upon merge C some_other_dir/some_sub_dir &gt; local add, incoming add upon merge </code></pre> <p>Essentially i want the versions of the files that are coming in from the merge and discard the current version.

2079615	0	Seeking good practice advice: multisite in Drupal <p>I'm using multisite to host my client sites.</p> <p>During development stage, I use subdomain to host the staging site, e.g. client1.mydomain.com.<br> And here's how it look under the SITES folder: </p> <pre><code>/sites/client1.mydomain.com </code></pre> <p>When the site is completed and ready to go live, I created another folder for the actual domain, e.g. client1.com. Hence:</p> <pre><code>/sites/client1.com </code></pre> <p>Next, I created symlinks under client1.com for FILES and SETTINGS.PHP that points to the subdomain<br> i.e. </p> <pre><code>/sites/client1.com/settings.php --&gt; /sites/client1.mydomain.com/settings.php /sites/client1.com/files --&gt; /sites/client1.mydomain.com/files </code></pre> <p>Finally, to prevent Google from indexing both the subdomain and actual domain, I created the rule in .htaccess to rewrite client1.mydomain.com to client1.com, therefore, should anyone try to access the subdomain, he will be redirected to the actual domain.</p> <p>This above arrangement works perfectly fine. But I somehow feel there is a better way to achieve the above in much simplified manner. Please feel free to share your views and all advice is much appreciated.</p>

14874445	0	Is the Monolithic God object in Javascript a performance concern? <h2>The way it is:</h2> <p>I have recently joined a webapp project which maintains, as a matter of standard, one single globally-available (ie, itself a property of <code>window</code>) object which contains, as properties or recursive sub-properties, all the functions and variables necessary to run the application — including stateful indicators for all the widgets, initialization aliases, generic DOM manipulation methods — <em>everything</em>. I would try to illustrate with simplified pseudo-code, but that defeats the point of my concern, which is that this thing is cyclopean. Basically nothing is encapsulated: everything single granular component can be read or modified from anywhere.</p> <h2>The way I'd like it:</h2> <p>In my recent work I've been the senior or only Javascript developer so I've been able to write in a style that uses functions, often immediately invoked / self-executing, for scoping discreet code blocks and keeping granular primitives as variables within those scopes. Using this pattern, everything is locked to its execution scope by default, and occasionally a few judiciously chosen getter/setter functions will be returned in cases where an API needs to be exposed.</p> <h2>…Is B more performant than A on a generic level?</h2> <p>Refactoring the code to functional parity from style A to style B is a gargantuan task, so I can't make any meaningful practical test for my assertion, but is the Monolithic God object anti-pattern a known performance monster compared to the scoped functional style? I would argue for B for the sake of legibility, code safety, and separation of concerns... But I imagine keeping everything in memory all the time, crawling though lookup chains etc would make it either an inherently performance-intensive exercise to access anything, or at least make garbage collection a very difficult task.</p>

38536136	0	Unique methods for use through the class rather than an object <p>So, I'm beginning to learn Java and I think it's an awesome programming language, however I've come across the <code>static</code> keyword which, to my understanding, makes sure a given method or member variable is accessible through the class (e.g. <code>MyClass.main()</code>) rather than solely through the object (<code>MyObject.main()</code>). My question is, is it possible to make certain methods only accessible through the class and not through the object, so that <code>MyClass.main()</code> would work, however <code>MyObject.main()</code> would not? Whilst I'm not trying to achieve anything with this, I'd just like to know out of curiosity.</p> <p>In my research I couldn't find this question being asked anywhere else, but if it is elsewhere I'd love to be pointed to it!</p> <p>Forgive me if it's simple, however I've been thinking on this for a while and getting nowhere.</p> <p>Thanks!</p>

30480178	0	innerText auto truncating long text inside a DOM element <p>I am trying to access the content inside a <strong>td</strong> element through the JavaScript <strong>innerText</strong> property (inside an excel VBA macro). It works perfectly for all cases except for this one case where the text inside the <strong>td</strong> element is very long (greater than 85982 characters).</p> <p>Upon inspection of the text extracted by innerText, I found that innerText seems to be truncating the text after a certain length. Note that this doesn't happen for other cases where the text size is small.</p> <p>Also, it seems that Mozilla's <strong>textContent</strong> property has a similar problem as well. I tried accessing the truncated part of the text using the developer console in Firefox for the aforementioned DOM element, but it seems that text isn't there in the extracted content (but the not truncated text is there - just like with innerText).</p> <p>Does anyone know how to bypass this restriction? Is there some internal limit on these functions?</p> <p>Here's my VBA code that has this problem:</p> <pre><code>MyInnerText = objElement.ChildNodes(3).innerText </code></pre> <p>Here's an equivalent code run in the Firefox console which has the same problem:</p> <pre><code>var t = document.getElementsByName("chapter11")[0].parentNode.children[3].textContent; t.match("some text that is in the part being truncated."); </code></pre> <p>For Firefox, this problem seems to go away if I inspect the element, and click "Show all 3396" nodes. After those nodes are visible, the textContent does not truncate the text anymore.</p> <p>Please do note that I want to be able to extract the text from inside a VBA script using the Internet Explorer object.</p>

I'll paste the code here, if you can help me you'll be thanked :) pacman is number 2, and ghost is number 3.</p> <pre><code>Queue&lt;Tile&gt; path = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;(); Tile start = new Tile(canvas.g1.x, canvas.g1.y, 3); Tile end = new Tile(canvas.pacman.x, canvas.pacman.y, 2); start.distance = 1; path.add(start); while (!path.isEmpty()) { Tile current = path.remove(); System.out.println(path.size()); canvas.walls[current.y][current.x] = 0; if (canvas.walls[current.y][current.x] == canvas.walls[end.y][end.x]) { end = current; System.out.println("pacman found"); break; } ArrayList&lt;Tile&gt; list = adyacent(current); for (Tile c : list) { if (c.distance == 0) { c.distance = current.distance + 1; path.add(c); canvas.walls[c.y][c.x] = 20; for (Tile v : path) { System.out.println("x: " + v.x + " / y: " + v.y + " / distance: " + v.distance); } } } } int dist = end.distance; System.out.println("Recolection ended, size: " + dist); </code></pre> <p>The class Tile():</p> <pre><code>public class Tile { public int x; public int y; public int distance; public int personaje; public Tile(int x, int y, int personaje) { this.x = x; this.y = y; this.personaje = personaje; distance = 0; } } </code></pre> <p>and the method adyacent():</p> <p>in this method, the numbers I check are the ones with wall(each one with a diferent drawing))</p> <pre><code>public ArrayList&lt;Tile&gt; adyacent(Tile c) { ArrayList&lt;Tile&gt; surrounding = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); int ant; ant = canvas.walls[c.y][c.x + 1]; if ((ant != 7) &amp;&amp; (ant != 8) &amp;&amp; (ant != 9) &amp;&amp; (ant != 11) &amp;&amp; (ant != 12) &amp;&amp; (ant != 13) &amp;&amp; (ant != 14) &amp;&amp; (ant != 15) &amp;&amp; (ant != 16)) { surrounding.add(new Tile(c.x + 1, c.y, 3)); } ant = canvas.walls[c.y][c.x - 1]; if ((ant != 7) &amp;&amp; (ant != 8) &amp;&amp; (ant != 9) &amp;&amp; (ant != 11) &amp;&amp; (ant != 12) &amp;&amp; (ant != 13) &amp;&amp; (ant != 14) &amp;&amp; (ant != 15) &amp;&amp; (ant != 16)) { surrounding.add(new Tile(c.x - 1, c.y, 3)); } ant = canvas.walls[c.y + 1][c.x]; if ((ant != 7) &amp;&amp; (ant != 8) &amp;&amp; (ant != 9) &amp;&amp; (ant != 11) &amp;&amp; (ant != 12) &amp;&amp; (ant != 13) &amp;&amp; (ant != 14) &amp;&amp; (ant != 15) &amp;&amp; (ant != 16)) { surrounding.add(new Tile(c.x, c.y + 1, 3)); } ant = canvas.walls[c.y - 1][c.x]; if ((ant != 7) &amp;&amp; (ant != 8) &amp;&amp; (ant != 9) &amp;&amp; (ant != 11) &amp;&amp; (ant != 12) &amp;&amp; (ant != 13) &amp;&amp; (ant != 14) &amp;&amp; (ant != 15) &amp;&amp; (ant != 16)) { surrounding.add(new Tile(c.x, c.y - 1, 3)); } return surrounding; } </code></pre> <p>What I've observed is that it never reaches the System.out in which I return the size of the path. Also, where I see the size of the Queue, it seems right, but the System.out in which I see "x" and "y" and "distance" is bigger each time, much much bigger.</p> <p>I set that the checked tiles change it's color, changing the number which I've got in the array: 0 is floor, 20 is transparent green. And it remains in center, and beggins to work slower and slower.</p> <p>Forget to say that it never finds pacman :( thanks!</p>

It's the InstallUtil /i section as I said previously.</p> <p>If someone could advise that'd be great.</p> <p>Thanks, Colin</p>

However, after testing newcrossgate to westcroydon which takes 26mins, I tried newcrossgate to crystalpalace and prolog said it should take 15 mins...despite the fact its the next station after westcroydon. Clearly somethings wrong here, however it works for most of the stations while coming up with a occasional error in time every now and again, can anyone tell me whats wrong? :S</p>

I tried importing the certificate into Firefox, to remedy the situation, and it did not help. However, with IE, exporting the certificate from IIS and importing it into the browser's Trusted Root Certificate Authorities store permitted IE to trust the self-signed certificate.</p> <p>It's important to note that the server's fully qualified domain name is webdev.dev.mysite.com, whereas the website address is webdev.mysite.com and I've had no problems with the site under HTTP.

20298283	0	MVVM approach, what's a good way? How to improve/speed up development? <p>this post is meant to have a list of suggestions on MVVM approach... What tools do you use, what do you do to speed up development, how do you maintain your application, any special ways of finding defects in this design pattern......</p> <p>here is what I do:</p> <p>So first i create my model/db with EF.</p> <p>Then I create Views (either user controls or windows) with their respective viewmodel. I usually place the viewmodel in the same location as my view. But while starting the name of my view with "UC-name", I call my viewmodel just "name-model".</p> <p>In my viewmodel I implement InotifyPropertyChanged</p> <p>in my xaml view I have a resource of my viewmodel, and bind my grids/controls via the itemsource to the staticresource.</p> <p>I try to do a lot of front end logic with triggers and styles and also place some code in the xaml.cs file if it regards logic for behaviour of my controls.</p> <p>I can reach my viewmodel from my view (xaml + xaml.cs).</p> <p>for communiation between viewmodels I use MVVM lights.</p> <p>that's pretty much it.</p> <hr> <p>Things I'm thinking about</p> <ul> <li><p>I'm thinking of using T4 templates for generating viewmodel/view. What do you guys think of this. is this worth it?</p></li> <li><p>when using MVVM light Messenger, we get a subscription based communication, and sometimes I find it hard to track what has changed in my DataContext. Any suggestions on this?</p></li> <li><p>any other improvements or suggestions are more than welcome !</p></li> </ul>

22774115	0	Google Maps API data.setStyle not showing icons on map <p>I'm trying to create a little app using the Google Maps JS API.

The file seems to be loading properly, and the map is displaying, but the icons that are set in the map.data.setstyle() won't show... </p> <p>Below is my HTML, CSS, and JS.

So, I still have no idea why the points wouldn't be showing up.</p>

13031542	0	algorithms to emulate human movement in a stick figure <p>I need to make a program that lets you animate a stick figure, so I'm looking for some information on algorithms to emulate human movement. I found some software that lets you create animations with stick figures, but are hard to use because basically they don't help you emulate realistic movement, so the animator is responsible for everything. That's cool when you are or have an animator, but I'm not, I'm only a programmer.</p> <p>I would really appreciate if someone knows about a library, or text with an explanation of these kinds of algorithms.</p>

18603273	0	NodeJS Code Coverage of Automated Tests <p>As part of a custom testing framework for a NodeJS REST API, I'd like to automatically detect when my tests are no longer providing proper coverage by comparing all <em>possible</em> outcomes with what the test suite received. </p> <p>What methods exist for doing this? We can assume that it's being used for a REST API with a list of entry functions (API endpoints) that need coverage analysis, and each entry function will end with a known 'exit function' that responds to the requester in a standard way. </p> <p>Here's what I've found so far:</p> <p><strong>1: Basic solution (Currently implemented)</strong></p> <ul> <li>When writing each REST endpoint, manually create a list of all the possible outcome 'codes' [Success, FailureDueToX, FailureDueToY] for example</li> <li>After the tests have run, ensure every code in the list has been seen by the test suite for each endpoint. </li> </ul> <p><em><strong>Pros:</strong></em> Very basic and easy to use; Doesn't change performance testing times</p> <p><em><strong>Cons:</strong></em> Highly prone to error with lots of manual checking; Doesn't flag any issues if there are 5 ways to 'FailDueToX' and you only test 1 of them. Very basic definition of 'coverage'</p> <p><strong>2: Static analysis</strong></p> <ul> <li>Parse the code into some sort of parse tree and look for all the instances of the 'exit function'</li> <li>Traverse up the tree until an API Endpoint is reached, and add that exit instance to the endpoint as an expected output (needs to keep a record of the stack trace to get there via a hash or similar)</li> <li>When tests are run, the endpoints return the stack trace hash or similar and this is compared to the expected output list.</li> </ul> <p><em><strong>Pros:</strong></em> Automatic; Catches the different branches that may result in the same output code</p> <p><em><strong>Cons:</strong></em> Generating the parse tree is non trivial; Doesn't detect dead code that never gets run; test suite needs to be kept in sync</p> <p><strong>3: Profiling</strong></p> <p>I've done this in the past on Embedded Systems with <a href="http://www.ghs.com/products/safety_critical/gcover.html" rel="nofollow">GreenHills Code Coverage Tools</a></p> <ul> <li>Start up a profiler like <a href="http://blog.nodejs.org/2012/04/25/profiling-node-js/" rel="nofollow">dtrace</a> and record the stack log for each test separately</li> <li>Parse the stack log and assign the 'test' to each line of code</li> <li>Manually analyse the code-with-annotations to find gaps.</li> </ul> <p><em><strong>Pros:</strong></em> Semi Automatic; Gives more information about total coverage to a developer; Can see </p> <p><em><strong>Cons:</strong></em> Slows down the tests; Unable to do performance testing in parallel; Doesn't flag when a possible outcome is never made to happen. </p> <p>What else is there, and what tools can help me with my Static Analysis and Profiling goals? </p>

19787198	1	Logging in web2py <p>I'm working on a web application that handles a bit of traffic. I tried using FileHandler, set up when handling each request, for logging but that resulted in wsgi crashing from too many open files, current limit is 1024 which seems reasonable.</p> <p>How do people handle logging when dealing with a bit of traffic? Is there a way for the wsgi process to use one filehandle for all requests?</p>

34526156	0	HTML5 Notification With PHP <p>I noticed Facebook started using the HTML5 notification for desktop and I thought I would start dabbling in it for fun for my blog. My idea is pretty simple: new blog comes out, apache cronjob runs every X minutes and calls a file, does some PHP wizardry and out goes the notification. </p> <p>I have looked online and found examples using <a href="https://codeforgeek.com/2014/10/desktop-notification-like-facebook-using-html5/">node.js and angular</a>, but I'm not comfortable using either of those so I'd rather stick with PHP. </p> <p>Here is my process: The user goes to my blog and will click a button to allow notifications. For brevity, the below code sends the users a notification when they click the "notify" button. This works perfectly, and in theory should subscribe them to any future notifications. </p> <pre><code>if ('Notification' in window) { function notifyUser() { var title = 'example title'; var options = { body: 'example body', icon: 'example icon' }; if (Notification.permission === "granted") { var notification = new Notification(title, options); } else if (Notification.permission !== 'denied') { Notification.requestPermission(function (permission) { if (permission === "granted") { var notification = new Notification(title, options); } }); } } $('#notify').click(function() { notifyUser(); return false; }); } else { //not happening } </code></pre> <p>You can see the <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/qdb1d414/">fiddle</a> of the above. </p> <p>Access to the user is granted and now I should be able to send them notifications whenever I want. Awesome! I then write up a blog entry and it has the ID of XYZ. My cronjob goes and calls the following PHP script, using the above node.js example as a template.</p> <p>(In this example I am just calling the script manually from my phone and watching my desktop screen. Since my desktop is "subscribed" to the same domain, I think the following would/should work.)</p> <pre><code>$num = $_GET['num']; $db = mysql_connect(DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS); if($db) { mysql_select_db('mydb', $db); $select = "SELECT alert FROM blog WHERE id = ".$num." &amp;&amp; alert = 0 LIMIT 1"; $results = mysql_query($select) or die(mysql_error()); $output = ''; while($row = mysql_fetch_object($results)) { $output .= "&lt;script&gt; var title = 'new blog!'; var options = { body: 'come read my new blog!', icon: 'same icon as before or maybe a new one!' }; var notification = new Notification(title, options); &lt;/script&gt;"; $update = "UPDATE blog SET alert = 1 WHERE id = ".$num." &amp;&amp; alert = 0 LIMIT 1"; mysql_query($update) or die(mysql_error()); } echo $output; } </code></pre> <p>I then check the database and blog entry XYZ's "alert" is now set to "1", yet my desktop browser never got notified. Since my browser is subscribed to the same URL that is pushing out the notification, I would imagine I'd get a message. </p> <p>Either I'm doing something wrong (perhaps PHP isn't the right language for this?), or I'm misunderstanding the spec. Could somebody help point me in the right direction? I think I'm missing something. </p> <p>Thanks a lot. </p> <p><strong>Update 1</strong></p> <p>According to the comments, if I just call a script with this in it:</p> <pre><code> var title = 'new blog!'; var options = { body: 'come read my new blog!', icon: 'same icon as before or maybe a new one!' }; var notification = new Notification(title, options); </code></pre> <p>It should hit all devices that are subscribed to my notifications. I tried this on my phone but my desktop still didn't get a notification. I still think I'm missing something as my notifications seem stuck to one device and can only be called on page-load or on click as opposed to Facebook which sends you notifications even if the page isn't open in your browser. </p>

The basic function of the servers is to make outbound HTTP requests for other services.</p> <p>It's worth noting that I don't believe this is caused by a memory leak. The server's memory usage remains constant (and low) during these freeze events, while the CPU spikes to 99%</p> <p>Another piece of evidence towards the conclusion of an infinite loop is that the event loop itself seems to have stopped. When I put a console.log inside of a setInterval, the server will stop outputting as soon as it freezes.</p> <p>We have verified that the problem is not caused by expired/corrupted socket connections, by setting the number of max connections to Infinity (which disables their reuse in node.js)</p> <p>We're using JSONStream 0.7.1 (which includes a default jsonparse version of 0.0.5). We found <a href="https://github.com/creationix/jsonparse/pull/22" rel="nofollow">this issue</a> on the JSONStream repo, and tried forking JSONParse and only updating to the newest jsonparse version. It did NOT fix the issue.</p>

16497020	0	.Net MVC binding dynamic Type to a Model at runtime <p>I have a slightly long conceptual question I'm wondering if somebody could help me out with. </p> <p>In MVC I've built a website which builds grids using <a href="http://demos.kendoui.com/web/grid/index.html" rel="nofollow">kendoui's framework</a>. </p> <p>All the grids on my website are constructed exactly the same except for the model they use and the CRUD methods that need to be implemented for each model. I set things up where each Model implement an interface for CRUD methods like below to get the logic all in one place.</p> <pre><code>//Actual interface has variables getting passed public interface IKendoModelInterface { void Save(); void Read(); void Delete(); } public class Model1: IKendoModelInterface { [Key] public int IdProperty1 { get; set; } public int SomeProperty2 { get; set; } public string SomeProperty3 { get; set; } public void Save(){ //Implement Save } public void Read(){ //Implement Read } public void Delete(){ //Implement Delete } } </code></pre> <p>Then to speed up the writing of all the scaffolding Action methods needed to get the grids to work I created an abstract Controller that can call the interface methods of the Model that gets passed into it. </p> <pre><code> //Implement the AJAX methods called by the grid public abstract class KendoGridImplController&lt;T&gt; : Controller where T : class, IKendoModelInterface { // Method called from kendo grid public virtual ActionResult Create([DataSourceRequest] DataSourceRequest request, [Bind(Prefix = "models")]IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; createdRecords) { //Invoke Create Method for Model and return results } public virtual ActionResult Read([DataSourceRequest]DataSourceRequest request, int Id) { //Invoke read method for model and return results } //Update and Delete also implemented.. } </code></pre> <p>Then I just need a Controller per model that implements the abstract controller above passing in the type of Model being used.</p> <pre><code> public class ResponsibilityMatrixController : KendoGridImplController&lt;Model1&gt; { //Set up the page the grid will be on public ActionResult Index(int id) { return View("SharedGridView", id); } //Can override abstract methods if needed but usually won't need to } </code></pre> <p>I'm wondering if I can take this one step further or if I've reached the end of the road. To me it just seems like more repeated code if I have to create a controller per Model that does nothing but pass in the type to the abstract controller and calls the same View. </p> <p>I attempted for quite a while yesterday to figure out if I could dynamically assign the type to the abstract controller. I setup something where I was sending back the type of model via strings and I could still invoke the methods needed. Where it failed, was that the mapping could no longer be done on any of the controller actions by default since the type isn't known at compile time. eg </p> <pre><code>public virtual ActionResult Create([DataSourceRequest] DataSourceRequest request, [Bind(Prefix = "models")]IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; createdRecords) </code></pre> <p>createdRecords can't be bound like this if T that's passed in is an interface and not the Model itself and I've found no real way to map the form data to an instance of a type that isn't known at compile time. </p> <p>I'm wondering if there's an easy way to do this mapping between an instance of the type of object getting passed in that I can figure out at runtime, if there's some other way to set this up that I'm overlooking or if both those things are going to be way too much work and I should just not attempt something like this and build a controller per model like I do now? </p>

However it would require more set up in the test, which could hinder it's readability. (And it would be a shame to re-implement something that could already be implemented in moq).</p> <p>For instance a lightweight way to do it could be to be able to retrieve the exact number of call to my method, so that I could <code>Assert.AreEqual</code> on it. But I haven't been able to find a way to do it so far.</p>

The way I am accomplishing this is by running the below javascript to dynamically add 'row' divs below each row of grid boxes that has expandable content.</p> <pre><code>function defineFocusRowLength() { var rowFocusBoxCount = 0; $('#isofocus .focusbox.core').each(function(){ rowFocusBoxCount++; if($(this).css('float') === 'right') { finalFocusRowBoxCount = rowFocusBoxCount; return false; } }); $('#isofocus .slidecontent').remove(); $('#isofocus .focusbox.core:nth-child('+finalFocusRowBoxCount+'n)').after('&lt;div class="slidecontent"&gt;&lt;div class="wrap"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'); if($('#isofocus .focusbox.core').last().css('float') === 'right') { // do nothing because it should have been caught by the previous line } else { $('#isofocus .focusbox.core').last().next('.focusbox').each(function(){ if($(this).css('float') === 'right') { if($(this).next('.focusbox').css('float') === 'right') { $(this).next('.focusbox').after('&lt;div class="slidecontent"&gt;&lt;div class="wrap"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'); } else { $(this).after('&lt;div class="slidecontent"&gt;&lt;div class="wrap"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'); } } }); } } defineFocusRowLength(); $(window).resize(function() { defineFocusRowLength(); }); </code></pre> <p>In case you are wondering, I am calling this function on window.resize as well because my site is responsive, so as the grid reorganizes this function removes the old expanded rows and creates new ones in the appropriate spaces.</p> <p>This part of my code all works beautifully. No problems whatsoever. However, it's when I try to target these new divs with .next() that completely fails.</p> <p>Here is the code I execute when you click the in each box:</p> <pre><code>$(".focusbox a.popup").click(function(){ var expandtext = $(this).parents('.focusbox').children('.expanded-content').html(); $(this).parents('.focusbox').next('.slidecontent').html(expandtext); $(this).parents('.focusbox').next('.slidecontent').slideToggle(); }) </code></pre> <p>Now, I have tried about 20 other variations of this code and they work. It is just this specific way I am needing it to work that fails. Here are some of the variations I used that worked, but were not the proper result:</p> <pre><code>$(this).parents('.focusbox').next().slideToggle(); //works, but slides up the next box, not the expanded row $(this).parents('.focusbox').siblings('.slidecontent').slideToggle(); //works but shows all expanded rows $(this).parents('#isofocus').find('.slidecontent').slideToggle(); //works but shows all expanded rows </code></pre> <p>So yeah, I'm pretty much at my wits end here and believe that this is just inherintly a flaw in jquery that the .next() function is unable to access selectors of content that is generated after page load, even if the function is not called until after the page has loaded. </p> <p>Here is my jsfiddle for you to take a stab at it: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/RCVfK/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/RCVfK/1/</a></p>
35288013	0	Recyclerview viewholder possible to change views at other adapter positions (not current position)? <p>I have a recyclerview with mediaplayer to play a song on each row. I only have one button for play/stop which changes symbol. </p> <p>Here is my problem:</p> <p>Example 1 (This works fine): </p> <p>(For adapter position 1) the user hits the play symbol and music plays for that adapter position and the symbol changes to a stop symbol, they then hit the stop symbol and the music stops and the symbol changes back to a play symbol ready to start the music again.</p> <p>Example 2 (This is the problem)</p> <p>(For adapter position 1) the user hits the play symbol and music plays for that adapter position and the symbol changes to a stop symbol. Without hitting that button again they then hit the play symbol (adapter position 3) so now they are trying to play the song on position 1 and 3 at the same time. I have fixed both songs playing at the same time so that when the the second song is pressed the media played is reset and the source song file is changed to the new song (only one will play at a time).</p> <p>The problem then becomes even though the media player is behaving as it should. The mediaplayer is controlled in the mainactivity. The play/stop button (imageview) image is changed in the the adapter viewholder and I can't work out a way to change the play/stop symbol when more than one song is clicked at the same time. </p> <p>This image shows the example both song 1 and song 3 have been pressed. Now only song 3 is playing but the images are still showing as if both songs are playing simultaneously.</p> <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FmsAA.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FmsAA.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p> <p>This is my view holder where I handle changing the play/stop image and send the song clicked callback:</p> <pre><code>class AddVideoAudioViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder{ ImageView PlayButton; Button AddAudioButton; TextView Title; public AddVideoAudioViewHolder(View itemView) { super(itemView); PlayButton = (ImageView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.PlayStopAudioDemo); PlayButton.setTag(1); PlayButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { int PlayStopButtonState = (int) PlayButton.getTag(); if (PlayStopButtonState == 1) { mVideoAudioCallbacks.onClick(100 + getAdapterPosition()); PlayButton.setImageResource(R.drawable.playstop); PlayButton.setTag(2); } else { mVideoAudioCallbacks.onClick(200 + getAdapterPosition()); PlayButton.setImageResource(R.drawable.playarrow); PlayButton.setTag(1); } } }); </code></pre> <p>and this is the method in the main activity where I handle the case of two songs playing:</p> <pre><code>public void PlaySong (int SongNumber, int ObjectInt){ if (mp == null) { mp = new MediaPlayer(); }else{ mp.reset(); } try { mp.setDataSource(this, Uri.parse("android.resource://com.example.nick.accountable/" + SongArray[SongNumber])); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } try { mp.prepare(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } mp.start(); } </code></pre> <p>So my question can I add some code in the view holder or in the main activity that can change all the other views than the current adapter position. I.e. If song number 3 is clicked to play, set the image for position 1-2 &amp; 4-10 as not playing or is there a better way to do it.</p> <p>Thanks for your help Nicholas</p>

11872269	0	stuck building a 'cart management' system <p>I'm trying to build a database for video spots. The main page is a list of spots and you can check them and modify them. What i want to do is build a cart system, where the checked spots' id's are automatically added to the cart and stored as a cookie. That way the use can browse multiple pages while still having everything stay checked.</p> <p>So far, I have a checkbox on every spot that when checked calls a function that adds the id of the checkbox to an array and stores it as a cookie. </p> <p>I'm able to retrieve the cookie through jquery. What I need to do is while looping through the spots and printing them, is to check if that spot id is in the cookie, so I can set it as checked or not through php. Is this possible? Is there a better way to accomplish this?</p> <p>Here is what i have so far.</p> <pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){ var checkedItems = []; $('.spotCheck').click(function(){ var currentID = this.id; checkedItems.push(currentID); updateCookie(); }); function updateCookie(){ $.cookie('itemList',checkedItems); } $('#mainContainer').click(function(){ $('#textInCenter').html($.cookie('itemList') ); }); }); </code></pre> <p>Clicking the checkbox adds the ID to the array checkedItems, and click the mainContainer makes it visible so I can see which items are currently in the array. I can browse through pages and the cookies stay in the array (there's no way to remove them now but I'm not worried about that right now).</p> <p>So how can I check the array to see if an id is in there when I print the list of spots?</p>

22260913	0	Is a real-time system sdhedulable? <p>There is a question in my operating systems book about scheduling a system. </p> <p>The question is: A real-time system needs to handle two voice calls that each run every 5 msec and consumes 1 msec of CPU time per burst, plus one video at 25 frames/sec, with each frame requiring 20 msec of CPU time. Is the system schedulable?</p> <p>The solution manual has this answer: Each voice call runs 200 times/second and uses up 1 msec per burst, so each voice call needs 200 msec per second or 400 msec for the two of them. The video runs 25 times a second and uses up 20 msec each time, for a total of 500 msec per second. Together they consume 900</p> <p>The book does not explain how to come to this conclusion, or gives an algorithm. So I was hoping someone could explain how this answer is worked out? </p> <p>Thank you.</p>

14380143	0	Matching binary patterns in C <p>I'm currently developing a C program that needs to parse some bespoke data structures, fortunately I know how they are structured, however I'm not sure of how to implement my parser in C.</p> <p>Each of the structures are 32-bits in length, and each structure can be identified by it's binary signature.</p> <p>As an example, there are two particular structures that I'm interested in, and they have the following binary patterns (x means either 0 or 1)</p> <pre><code> 0000-00xx-xxxx-xxx0 0000-10xx-10xx-xxx0 </code></pre> <p>Within these structures the 'x' bits contain the actual data I need, so essentially I need a way of identifying each structure based on how the bits are written within each structure.</p> <p>So as an example in pseudo-code:</p> <pre><code>if (binaryPattern = 000010xxxxxxxxx0) { do something with it; } </code></pre> <p>I'm guessing that reading them as ints, and then performing some kind of bitmasking would be the way to go, but my knowledge of C isn't great, and maybe a simple logical OR operation would do it, but I just wanted some advice on doing this before I start.</p> <p>Thanks</p> <p>Thanks very much to everyone that has answered, very helpful!!</p>

29424477	0	How do I make a hotkey to activate a specific VMware Workstation VM? <p>I'm using the latest version of VMware Workstation (11.1.0) on Windows 7 x64 and I want to be able to do a keystroke of "Ctrl + 1" to go to VM #1, "Ctrl + 2" to go to VM #2, and "Ctrl + 3" to go to VM #3.</p> <p>Sounds simple right? It isn't.</p> <p>On Mac OS X, achieving this functionality is trivial with VMware Fusion in combination with Spaces / Mission Control - you can simply put each VM on a separate space and then define whatever space hotkeys you want. I'm migrating from OS X and want this same functionality.</p> <p>For reference, here are some potential solutions that I've tried and can verify that they don't work:</p> <p><strong>1) AutoHotkey</strong></p> <p>AutoHotkey can be used to make hotkeys like so:</p> <pre><code>^1::WinActivate, Win7(1) - VMware Workstation ^2::WinActivate, Win7(2) - VMware Workstation ^3::WinActivate, Win7(3) - VMware Workstation </code></pre> <p>These work to <strong>enter</strong> the VMs, but not to exit; Workstation will feed the "Ctrl + 1" to the VM and AutoHotkey does not take precedence, even if AutoHotkey is run as an administrator.</p> <p><strong>2) Suspend/Unsuspend with AutoHotkey</strong></p> <p>This promising post suggests that suspending and that unsuspending AutoHotkey while the VMware window is active will fix the problem:</p> <p><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/232762/autohotkey-script-to-exit-vmware-window">http://superuser.com/questions/232762/autohotkey-script-to-exit-vmware-window</a></p> <p>However, even after copying the exact code and making the necessary string modifications, I can't get it to work with Workstation.</p> <p><strong>3) Remote Desktop and/or VNC</strong></p> <p>One possible solution, if all 3 of the VMs in question were running Windows, would be to use Microsoft's Remote Desktop feature. However, one or more of the VMs that I intend to use will be running Linux.</p> <p>On Linux, it is possible to just use VNC. However, VNC has considerable drawbacks when compared to the native VMware Workstation console window: there is no sound, the resolution won't automatically scale, the performance will be bad, and so forth.</p> <p>Lastly, the VMs will be on 1) networks that won't be connected to the host via a bridged NIC (with the NIC disabled on the host) and 2) using a VPN without any split tunnel. So there will be no connectivity for either remote desktop or VNC in the first place.</p> <p><strong>3) A Windows Keyboard Hook</strong></p> <p>Liuk explains how to use a Windows hook to intercept keystrokes using C++: </p> <p><a href="http://polytimenerd.blogspot.com/2011/02/intercepting-keystrokes-in-any.html" rel="nofollow">http://polytimenerd.blogspot.com/2011/02/intercepting-keystrokes-in-any.html</a></p> <p>However, after testing with the demo program, it seems that this method does not intercept keystrokes sent to VMware Workstation.</p> <p><strong>4) FullScreenSwitch.directKey</strong></p> <p>It seems that in VMware Workstation used to have this kind of functionality built in, as documented in this SuperUser thread:</p> <p><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/71901/vmware-workstation-keyboard-shortcut">http://superuser.com/questions/71901/vmware-workstation-keyboard-shortcut</a></p> <p>However, VMware's documentations states that this is for VMware Workstation 5.0. I tried adding these strings to my VMX file and they had no effect, so the functionality must have been depreciated somewhere along the lines between Workstation 5 and 11.</p> <p><strong>5) PSExec</strong></p> <p>Wade Hatler mentions that he accomplishes this using PSExec to activate the appropriate AutoHotkey script on the host machine:</p> <p><a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/64359-sending-keystrokes-to-vmware-player/" rel="nofollow">http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/64359-sending-keystrokes-to-vmware-player/</a></p> <p>This solution is questionable in that you have to keep the password of your host machine in plaintext in order to pass it to PSExec.</p> <p>Regardless, this solution will not work for the reasons also described in #2 above: the VMs in question will be on 1) networks that won't be connected to the host via a bridged NIC (with the NIC disabled on the host) and 2) using a VPN without any split tunnel. So there will not be guaranteed connectivity between the host and the guest.</p> <p><strong>6) Execute a "Host" keystroke between every "Ctrl + #" keystroke</strong></p> <p>This is problematic in that it doubles the amount of keystrokes involved and makes it impossible to "flip" through all of my VMs by holding down control and hitting 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5, and so forth.</p> <p><strong>7) Use the "Host + Left/Right Arrow" hotkey and/or VMware-KVM.exe for cycling functionality</strong></p> <p>This is problematic in that when I have 10 or more VMs open at a time, rotating through all of them becomes incredibly cumbersome and inefficient.</p>

This seems awkward as well</p></li> </ol> <p><strong>Note:</strong> I've been instructed by my boss to make every function return an <code>enum</code> error code, so just using a <code>size_</code> and creating a vector, then returning that data is not an option.</p>
15234654	0	JPG Concatenation with Javascript <p>This is a LONG shot, but maybe someone out here is a super-genius. </p> <p>I want to combine 4 jpgs in a grid </p> <pre><code>1 2 3 4 </code></pre> <p>I want to do this client side, without SVG (because IE blows).</p> <p>I'm looking at manipulating the code inside the jpg files to produce a single, new image. I will get them as all same-sized jpgs, and I can output them to another format (like bitmap) if necessary. I'm also wiling to accept solutions using any special IE "features" like VML. IE8 is the target audience. </p> <p>I realize I can do this with SVG. I realize I can do this server-side. I realize I can css them next to each other. I need a single image from the 4 originals, as a string is fine (even preferable) because I can base64 encode it and throw it in an image element.</p> <p>Thanks!</p>

34888901	1	What's the best way to index a large number of arrays for calculating the cosine similarity? <p>Goal: calculating the most relevant article using cosine similarity. </p> <p>I have a function that will produce an array of scores of different topics for each article. For example:</p> <p>[0.6, 0.7, 1] represent the article's scores in the [math, physics, bio] category.</p> <p>With a given article, I will find the most relevant article by calculating the cosine similarity between the array of given article against the rest of the arrays of other articles.</p> <p>I am thinking of using pickle to store my data and use numpy to calculate cosine similarity and it can find cosine similarity very fast with matrix manipulation. However I am running into a decision problem as of how to index each array with its corresponding article id. </p> <p>I have thought of storing each array into a dictionary with the key as the article id and the value as the array. However, i think that will make it hard for me to calculate cosine similarity among a large number of arrays.</p> <p>Any suggestions and ideas would be greatly appreciated, thanks!</p>

Why isn't there a solution? Does everyone just put all of their JavaScript into the razor view? Does no one isolate code into modules anymore?

37979276	0	Google Maps: How to draw labels (country, city names, etc.) over my overlay <p>I need to draw some graphics over google maps. Graphics is not always transparent, so I'd like to draw text labels (country names, city names, etc.) over my graphics.</p> <p>For graphics I use <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/maptypes#OverlayMapTypes" rel="nofollow">overlay map type</a> , it is shown over base map. But I failed to draw labels over it?</p> <p>I guessed that there shall be a way to draw base map twice, with different style settings (so I style map with not labels, put my overlay, and then put overlay with roadmap with labels only), but it does not seem like I can use basic map types as overlay ones. Another way I see is to manually get tile with labels only by composing URL. This works, but as far as I understand accessing map tiles directly is prohibited by ToS.</p> <p>Is there a working and, well, legal way to do that?</p> <p>Here is jsfiddle which illustrates URL composing solution: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/GRaAL/jyr81p2c/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/GRaAL/jyr81p2c/</a></p> <pre><code>// here is how I get google maps tile with labels only function getLabelsOnlyTile(coord, zoom) { return "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/vt?pb=!1m5!1m4!1i" + zoom + "!2i" + (coord.x) + "!3i" + (coord.y) + "!4i512!2m3!1e0!2sm!3i353022921!3m14!2sen!3sUS!5e18!12m1!1e47!12m3!1e37!2m1!1ssmartmaps!12m4!1e26!2m2!1sstyles!2zcC52Om9mZixzLmU6bHxwLnY6b24!4e0"; } </code></pre>

33419570	0	jquery validate requires two clicks to submit <p>I have a form that has two buttons. One to edit a specific candidate after the information has been submitted, another button to just submit and add another candidate. Since there are two buttons on the screen, I need to know which one was clicked so that I can escort the user down the right path. </p> <p>I am using the jQuery Validation Plugin to help me validate the form before posting it. To prevent users from double clicking the button and submitting a duplicate candidate, I am disabling the button and changing the button to "Submitting" as demonstrated here:</p> <pre><code>/* This will change the button only if the form has passed and change the button to submitting and disable it */ submitHandler: function(form) { $('#saveandadd').click(function() { $('#saveandadd').val('Submitting...'); $('saveandadd', this).attr('disabled', 'disabled'); form.submit(); }); $('#saveandedit').click(function() { $("input[name='setvalue']").val('1'); $('#saveandedit').val('Submitting...'); $('saveandedit', this).attr('disabled', 'disabled'); form.submit(); </code></pre> <p>So far this is nice as I can change the button that was clicked to submitting. However, I have noticed a strange problem. Either button requires two clicks to submit it. </p> <p>I have setup a fiddle here: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/mwoods98/vge2bh8w/1/" rel="nofollow">Form Validation</a> that requires the first and last name to be filled in.

37389340	0	Can not find module TypeScript <p>I am converting my nodejs project into typescript nodejs. I have changed the extensions of .js files to .ts, however now I am getting <strong>require()</strong> errors. To overcome this problem, I tried </p> <pre><code>import express from "express" </code></pre> <p>However this gives me <strong>"Can not find module error"</strong>. I have researched it and narrowed it down to the issue where I guess TypeScript needs <strong>express.d.ts</strong> file for detecting the Express module. However I couldn't find the <strong>express.d.ts</strong> file anywhere in my project. Which ultimately means I am missing something.</p> <p>Can somebody point me in the right direction or perhaps help me resolve this problem?</p>

19243938	0	Keep the text in textboxes saved <p>I have these textboxes where the user enters data and then presses a button to process the data. Now the data entered by the user is alot and to give the user some slack I want to make it possible whenever you press the button, the application saves the data, so when you close the application and start it back up again the textboxes are filled with the last entered data.</p> <p>I was thinking about using a .txt file to save the data. Only I have found some difficulties with this. One of the problems is that I keep getting a messagebox from the microsoft .NET Framework everytime I try to run my application. The messagebox says the Index was outside the bounds of the array. Even though I think my code doesn't exceed the bounds of my array.</p> <p>And here is the code that I use:</p> <p>First I declared an array and filled it with variables that contain the content of the textboxes:</p> <pre><code>string[]settings = new string[5]; settings[0] = openKey; settings[1] = secretKey; settings[2] = statusRequestPath; settings[3] = statusRequestAPI; settings[4] = setSeconds.ToString(); </code></pre> <p>Then I use the following code to write the data to a text file.</p> <pre><code>using (StreamWriter writeFile = new StreamWriter(@"C:\Audio Silence Detector\AudioSilenceDetector.txt")) { foreach (string line in settings) { writeFile.WriteLine(line); } } </code></pre> <p>And to put the text of the .txt file back in the application I have put this in the formload:</p> <pre><code>string[] lines = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(@"C:\Audio Silence Detector\AudioSilenceDetector.txt"); tbOpenKey.Text = lines[0]; tbSecretKey.Text = lines[1]; tbStatusRequestPath.Text = lines[2]; tbStatusRequestAPI.Text = lines[3]; tbSeconds.Text = lines[4]; </code></pre> <p>I changed my code to this and it seems to have fixed the issue I was having:</p> <pre><code> if (lines.LongLength == 5) { tbOpenKey.Text = lines[0]; tbSecretKey.Text = lines[1]; tbStatusRequestPath.Text = lines[2]; tbStatusRequestAPI.Text = lines[3]; tbSeconds.Text = lines[4]; } </code></pre>

Originally I could run tests and interact via the browser.</p> <p>Now I'm asking for some direction on how to debug this. Basically, if I step through my test case, I reach a line like this: <code>Tranactions response = client.Get(request);</code> and then it raises an exception. I'm thinking I should download the servicestack source and add the project to my solution, in order to step through that code and get further insight into what's going on. Any advice?</p>

8020748	0	IndicatingAjaxButton works only once <p>I have derived a class from IndicatingAjaxButton (which is the button to a form). But the IAjaxIndicatorAware does only work once, i.e. if the validation of the form fails I print feedback messages within the form. During the 1st request the "onProgress-Circle" is shown. But if I click on the button again (after I made the right input on the form), there is no "onProgress-Circle" anymore. </p> <p>I took a look in the generated HTML: 1) Before the first click, there is a img tag, which gets displayed when the request is started 2) After the first request is processed, this img tag is removed. </p> <p>This are the evaluation steps that are returned from the server:</p> <pre><code>&lt;evaluate&gt;&lt;![CDATA[var e = Wicket.$('previouse--ajax-indicator'); if (e != null &amp;&amp; typeof(e.parentNode) != 'undefined') e.parentNode.removeChild(e);]]&gt;&lt;/evaluate&gt; </code></pre> <p>This I guess leads to removing all childs from the button, also the img tag.

27536812	0	const-correctness in void methods and lambda 'trick' <p>I have a method that accepts a reference of an object as const, this method doesn't change anything of the method and the const indicates that, the thing is that this method also calls other method that is within the class and is void, doesn't accept any argument and is also virtual, meaning that the class that extends the base class can override the method BUT it needs to be const as well. Eg:</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; class Boz { public: virtual void introduce() const = 0; }; class Foo { public: virtual void callable() const { // ... } void caller(const Boz&amp; object) const { callable(); object.introduce(); } }; class Bar : public Boz { public: void introduce() const { std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hi." &lt;&lt; std::endl; } }; class Biz : public Foo { public: void callable() const { std::cout &lt;&lt; "I'm being called before the introduce." &lt;&lt; std::endl; } }; int main(void) { Biz biz; biz.caller(Bar()); return 0; } </code></pre> <p>The output would be:</p> <pre><code>I'm being called before the introduce. Hi. </code></pre> <p>As you can see <code>callable</code> must to be const in order to be called. If I change and do this:</p> <pre><code>class Biz : public Foo { public: void callable() { std::cout &lt;&lt; "I'm being called before the introduce." &lt;&lt; std::endl; } }; </code></pre> <p>It will compile not errors are thrown but the callable method won't be called, but the virtual one as it's defined as const. It's quite obvious.</p> <p>The trickiest part here:</p> <pre><code>class Foo { public: virtual void callable() { // ... } void caller(const Boz&amp; object) const { auto trick = [&amp;] () { callable(); }; trick(); object.introduce(); } }; class Biz : public Foo { public: void callable() { std::cout &lt;&lt; "I'm being called before the introduce." &lt;&lt; std::endl; } }; </code></pre> <p>It works and the <code>callable</code> method is called. No errors like <code>passing 'const ...' as 'this' argument</code>.</p> <p>What I'm trying to do is to call <code>callable</code> without the need of being const and the reason is simple: The method doesn't change anything, he don't have access to the object that is begin passed as argument on <code>caller</code> method then we assume that he doesn't have the need to be <code>const</code> but the compiler throws an error even that way. The real problem is that <code>callable</code> is virtual and classes can extend the base class, implement their own <code>callable</code> and try to call other methods but can't if it's not <code>const</code> as well.</p> <p>What I want is pretty much that, is to know how can I call the virtual method without the need of being const (the reason is pretty much that, I'm kind forcing the users that extends the class and override the <code>callable</code> method to only call <code>const</code> methods and this is not what I want) and of course understand what happens with the lambda and why it works.</p>

What I'm trying to do is:</p> <pre><code>try: x = int(input()) except ValueError as var: # HERE I WANT TO USE THE 'x' STRING VALUE </code></pre> <p>I know about the the various ways to use the <strong>exception message</strong> (for instance by using <code>str(var)</code>).</p> <p>For example, if the input is <code>bla</code> which would cause a ValueError exception, <code>print(var)</code> outputs <code>invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'bla'</code>, which is not really usable. </p> <p>However, I created this program that should use <code>str(var)</code> to my advantage:</p> <pre><code>try: x = int(input()) except ValueError as var: s = str(var) print('Exception message: ' +s) i=0 while (s[i] != '\''): i = i+1 i = i+1 print_str = '' while (s[i] != '\''): print_str = print_str + str(s[i]) i++ print('print_str = ' + print_str) </code></pre> <p>This program would probably work after a few changes..</p> <p>So my question is: Is there a more direct way to get the 'x' string value?</p>

137060	0	Too many "pattern suffixes" - design smell? <p>I just found myself creating a class called "InstructionBuilderFactoryMapFactory". That's 4 "pattern suffixes" on one class. It immediately reminded me of this:</p> <p><a href="http://www.jroller.com/landers/entry/the_design_pattern_facade_pattern" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.jroller.com/landers/entry/the_design_pattern_facade_pattern</a></p> <p>Is this a design smell? Should I impose a limit on this number? </p> <p>I know some programmers have similar rules for other things (e.g. no more than N levels of pointer indirection in C.)</p> <p>All the classes seem necessary to me. I have a (fixed) map from strings to factories - something I do all the time. The list is getting long and I want to move it out of the constructor of the class that uses the builders (that are created by the factories that are obtained from the map...) And as usual I'm avoiding Singletons.</p>

25737201	0	Six degrees of Kevin Bacon <p>There are a couple other posts about degrees of Kevin Bacon, and the answers on those posts are similar to what I came up with myself before looking it up. But it's evident that I'm still doing something wrong from the results I get and the way the performance of my query falls off as I increase the degree of separation from Kevin Bacon.</p> <p>Here's my query to find all actors with one degree of Kevin Bacon:</p> <pre><code>match p=(:Person {name:"Kevin Bacon"})-[:ACTED_IN*..2]-(:Person) return p </code></pre> <p>If I understand correctly, that's equivalent to this:</p> <pre><code>match p=(:Person {name:"Kevin Bacon"})-[:ACTED_IN]-&gt;()&lt;-[:ACTED_IN]-(:Person) return p </code></pre> <p>And indeed, both of these queries return the same number of rows. But if I modify the first version of the query and increase the path length to 6 (i.e., three degrees of Kevin Bacon) it returns 978 rows. There are only 133 Person nodes in the database, so I would expect it to return at most 133 rows.</p> <p>My guess is that it's returning multiple paths to some of the Person nodes. How do I tell it to return only the shortest path to each? Basically, I want to perform a single depth-first or breadth-first search. I think it might involve <code>WITH</code>, but I don't really understand how to use that yet.</p>
37420319	0	Accessing Atlas, individual, and embedded resources/images easily <p>Basically, I have a bunch of images that I can combine into a single image(an atlas) or use individually. For testing/designing purposes, I would like to keep all the images separate but for release they should all be combine into the atlas(for non-embeddable compilers) or embedded.</p> <p>e.g., suppose I have 100 sprites. I can create a single atlas for them, use them all individually unembedded, or embed the atlas, or embed all the image.</p> <p>I'd like to start out with the individual+unembedded case for development then move to the embedded atlas case or embedded individual case(but I think this is probably not as good as the embedded atlas).</p> <p>Is there an easy way to set this up in C# so the transition will be minimal?</p> <p>The problem with the embedded atlas is that I would have to convert loading images(simple Image.FromFile into extracting images from the atlas).</p> <p>Just curious what would be a good approach to remove the need for rewriting a lot of code in the future when the switch is made.</p> <p>I could have something like Image.FromAtlas that essentially figures out the details(uses FromFile if we are in "development mode" or extracts the image from the atlas if in production... I think the embedded case would be rather trivial to implement).</p> <p>What do you think? Thanks.</p>

34910745	0	What are the best practices for single-instanced classes in java? <p>In my program I have a menu system in which I have a separate class for each menu, for example MainMenu would be a separate class. But the class is only supposed to be instanced once, and after I instance it, it is saved in a list which is all is used for after that. Should I use another solution than a separate class? Or should I make the constructor private and then make a private instance inside the class? I feel like this violates OOP, but I don't see another solution.</p>

12977334	0	Multithreading and passing data to new threads <p>I have some issues with an application I'm coding. It's job is to solve a maze using threads. One thread begins, and for each bifurcation it calls a static method in another class, passing parameters that the other thread needs, and then starts threads for each path. My outputs are all messed up, and I'm not sure if it's a Multithreading problem or maybe a problem with the references. Here's some of the code (Each thread is given a new instance of an <code>Explorer</code> class):</p> <p>This is the <code>Run()</code> method for each thread:</p> <pre><code>public void Explore() { while (ImDone == false) { Move(); if (ActualPosition[0] != Labyrinth.ExitPoint[0] || ActualPosition[1] != Labyrinth.ExitPoint[1]) //I'm not at the end.. continue; PrintMyStatus(); //Print in the console my parents and my complete route.. break; } </code></pre> <p>This is the <code>Move()</code> method:</p> <pre><code>List&lt;int[]&gt; validPaths = CheckSurroundings(); //returns a list of paths switch (validPaths.Count) { case 0: ImDone = true; //No more routes available break; case 1: MarkMyPosition(validPaths); //Change internal variables to the only new path break; default: lock(this) //As this involves thread creating I locked it.. { //Creating deep copies of my "History" so my childs can have them.. List&lt;int[]&gt; DCValidPaths = DeepCopy(validPaths); List&lt;string&gt; DCMyParents = DeepCopy(MyParents); string[,] DCMyExplorationMap = DeepCopy(MyExplorationMap); List&lt;int[]&gt; DCMyPositions = DeepCopy(MyPositions); foreach (var path in validPaths) { DCMyParents.Add(Thread.CurrentThread.Name); //Adding myself as a parent ExplorationManager.ExplorerMaker( DCValidPaths, DCMyParents, DCMyExplorationMap, DCMyPositions, ID); //Threads are created in the static class } } break; } </code></pre> <p>My <code>DeepCopy()</code> method is using is the one in the accepted answer of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/129389/how-do-you-do-a-deep-copy-an-object-in-net-c-specifically">this</a> question. Any other info needed I'll be more than happy to provide in order to solve the problem. Thanks in advance for your help.</p> <p>EDITS: My problem consists basically in: I'm having an <code>OutOfMemoryException</code> in the <code>Thread.Start()</code> clause and the Path displayed by the threads contain corrupted data (incorrect positions). I tested the <code>CheckSurroundings()</code> method and by far only returns correct positions (The labyrinth is contained in a two-dimensional string array).</p> <p>This is the constructor of the <code>Explorer</code> class:</p> <pre><code>public Explorer(List&lt;string&gt; myParents, int[] actualPosition, string[,] myExplorationMap, List&lt;int[]&gt; myPositions, int ID) { //Here I pass the data specified in Move(); MyParents = myParents; ActualPosition = actualPosition; MyExplorationMap = myExplorationMap; MyPositions = myPositions; this.ID = ID + 1; //An ID for reference //Marking position in my map with "1" so I know I've been here already, //and adding the position given to my list of positions MyExplorationMap[ActualPosition[0], ActualPosition[1]] = "1"; MyPositions.Add(DeepCopy(ActualPosition)); } </code></pre> <p>And this is the class creating the threads:</p> <pre><code>public static class ExplorationManager { public static void ExplorerMaker(List&lt;int[]&gt; validPaths, List&lt;string&gt; myParents, string[,] myExplorationMap, List&lt;int[]&gt; myPositions, int ID) { foreach (var thread in validPaths.Select (path =&gt; new Explorer(myParents, path, myExplorationMap, myPositions,ID)). Select(explorer =&gt; new Thread(explorer.Explore))) { thread.Name = "Thread of " + ID + " generation"; thread.Start(); //For each Path in Valid paths, create a new instance of Explorer and assign a thread to it. } } } </code></pre> <p>And the method returning the ValidPaths</p> <pre><code> private List&lt;int[]&gt; CheckSurroundings() { var validPaths = new List&lt;int[]&gt;(); var posX = ActualPosition[0]; var posY = ActualPosition[1]; for (var dx = -1; dx &lt;= 1; dx++) { if (dx == 0 || (posX + dx) &lt; 0 || (posX + dx) &gt;= Labyrinth.Size || MyExplorationMap[posX + dx, posY] == "1") continue; var tempPos = new int[2]; tempPos[0] = posX + dx; tempPos[1] = posY; validPaths.Add(tempPos); } for (var dy = -1; dy &lt;= 1; dy++) { if (dy == 0 || (posY + dy) &lt; 0 || (posY + dy) &gt;= Labyrinth.Size || MyExplorationMap[posX, posY + dy] == "1") continue; var tempPos = new int[2]; tempPos[0] = posX; tempPos[1] = posY + dy; validPaths.Add(tempPos); } //This method checks up, down, left, right and returns the posible routes as `int[]` for each one return validPaths; } </code></pre> <p>CheckSurroundings uses the deep copy passed to the child (via the constructor) to validate the routes he can take. It is NOT intended to alterate the parent's copy, because he is now in ANOTHER path of the labyrinth. The child only needs the information updated (passed via the constructor) UNTIL the point they "separate". And also EACH child must be independent from the other childs. That's what I'm trying to do. But I'm not sure what's wrong, maybe concurrency problem? Please help. If you need anything else let me know. –</p>

20443262	0	"A reference may be bound only to an object", why is "const int &ref = 3;" valid? <p>I am just starting learning c++. I found an advice on Internet: "Learn with a good book, it is better than videos on youtube." So as I am motivated and I have time I learn with c++ Primer 5th Ed.</p> <p>In this book, they say: Note: "A reference is not an object. Instead, a reference is just another name for an already existing object."</p> <p>and: "a reference may be bound only to an object, not to a literal or to the result of a more general expression"</p> <p>I understand:</p> <pre><code>int i = 3; int &amp;ri = i; // is valid: ri is a new name for i int &amp;ri2 = 2; // is not valid: 2 is not an object </code></pre> <p>Then I don't understand why:</p> <pre><code>const int &amp;ri3 = 2; // is valid </code></pre> <p>They write: "It can be easier to understand complicated pointer or reference declarations if you read them from right to left."</p> <p>Ok, it is not very complicated. I understand: I declare a variable named ri3, it is a reference (a reference when &amp; is after the type, an address when &amp; is in an expression) to an object of type int and it is a constant.</p> <p>I think it has already been explained many times but when I search on forums I find complicated (to me) answers to complicated problems, and I still don't understand. </p> <p>Thank you for your help.</p>

3451451	0	Why do people spend so much time searching for, and hacking around with, "free" toolsets when superior pay ones are available? <p><strong>Clarification:</strong> I'm referring to companies that pay developers, professionally. I understand why a "hobby" or "for fun" developer wouldn't want to (or couldn't afford) a fully-features pay tool, and may prefer to tinker. I'm talking about situations where a deadline is bearing down on a developer/company and development time is diverted away from the goal in pursuit of a "Free" tool to accomplish what a pay one is available to do.</p> <hr> <p>I've noticed a number of Stack Overflow questions recently (they're not new, I've just recently taken notice) where people are searching for free alternatives to popular development tools for things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ALM</a>, database comparison, and other functions for which there's a trivially costly pay alternative. The "Free" tag on Stack Overflow has 350 questions, and it doesn't take long to see dozens of examples of "Is there a FREE tool to do X?" followed by discussions that must have taken the asker hours to research and participate in.</p> <p>It's not just about paying less - I'm often amazed at the hoops that some developers (or, perhaps more accurately, their companies) will go through to avoid paying for something - in some cases, a pay solution will be avoided in favor of a poorly documented, buggy, feature-incomplete open-source solution that results in dozens of hours of work that could have been avoided.</p> <p>I understand the most obvious reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Company is short on cash</li> <li>Don't pay for something when a (functionally-comparable) free alternative is available</li> <li>"Hobby" developers don't have the cash to spare, and since they're just learning, it doesn't make sense to pay for a toolset they're only tinkering with</li> </ul> <p>However, I think the "short on cash" reasoning is completely bogus - as a developer not long out of college, I made about $50K annually, or $200/day (meaning my company probably paid close to $300/day to have me in my chair, all considered). When you compare that price to a $300 tool, the obvious answer is "if it's going to waste more than a day of your time, you should buy it instead and get back to work". However, that's not what I observe - people seem willing to kill dozens of hours to avoid paying for something that only costs $50.</p> <p>Help me understand - as a developer myself of tools I'd like to one day sell, I want to understand the mentality. Have I been spoiled by working at a company that's not afraid to spend? Is there an ingrained reason developers (or their companies) don't want to spend money? Can people not accurately estimate the costs of "Free" tools in terms of lost productivity?</p> <hr> <p>I'm not referring to instances where a great free alternative is available. For example, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/662956/most-useful-free-net-libraries">any of these tools</a> is a great example of something you shouldn't pay for. However, let's say one of those lacks a key feature you need, and which a pay version of the same library provides - people seem to lean towards hacking around with the free version to add the needed functionality (or scaffold in the needed functionality) instead of ditching the free tool in favor of the pay (and feature-complete) version. I'm not saying that's the wrong choice, but it's just a choice I want to understand the reasoning to. The important point is that I'd like to - my intent is not to be argumentative.</p>

32019322	0	HOWTO create GoogleCredential by using Service Account JSON <p>I am using the Java SDK for <code>Android Publisher v2</code> and <code>Oauth2 v2</code>. Once I created the service account I was provided with a JSON of <code>Google Play Android Developer</code> service account with client id, email, private key etc. I have tried to look around and figure out how to create a Credential so that I use the AndoirdPublisher service to fetch info on my Android App's users subscriptions, entitlements etc and store this info on our backend servers.</p> <p>I am getting hard time trying to figure out how to go about this. None of the documentations I have seen so far help in creating <code>GoogleCredential</code> using the downloaded JSON. </p> <p>For example there is this <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> but it mentions only about P12 file and not the JSON. I want to avoid P12 if possible since I have multiple clients &amp; I would like to save this JSON in some sort of database &amp; then use it to create credential for each client.</p> <p>Just to clarify I am trying to create the GoogleCredential object as described here,</p> <pre><code>import com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2.GoogleCredential; import com.google.api.client.googleapis.javanet.GoogleNetHttpTransport; import com.google.api.client.http.HttpTransport; import com.google.api.client.json.JsonFactory; import com.google.api.client.json.jackson2.JacksonFactory; import com.google.api.services.sqladmin.SQLAdminScopes; // ...

This callback should return true or false. True mean that the point should be added to the map and false means cancel adding this point to the map.</p> <p>Now the callback looks like this:</p> <pre><code>onPointAdded = function(feature) { var f = feature.feature; var result = false; $('#dialog-point-add').dialog({ modal : true, buttons : { 'Add point' : function() { result = true; $(this).dialog("close"); }, 'Cancel' : function() { result = false; $(this).dialog("close"); } } }); return result; }; </code></pre> <p>The problem is that this dialog doesn't block the executing code. I'm asking You How to handle this situation? I want to show dialog to the user with confirmation for adding the point.</p>

With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--Responsive Video Slider and Title--&gt; &lt;div id="Recent-Projects"&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Recent Projects&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id="video-wrapper"&gt; &lt;span class="cycle-prev"&gt;&amp;#9001&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cycle-next"&gt;&amp;#9002&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div class="cycle-slideshow" data-cycle-carousel-visible="3" data-cycle-fx="carousel" data-cycle-timeout="0" data-cycle-auto-height="640:360" data-cycle-prev=".cycle-prev" data-cycle-next=".cycle-next" data-cycle-slides="&gt;iframe" data-cycle-youtube="true" data-cycle-youtube-autostart="true" data-cycle-pager=".cycle-pager" data-cycle-carousel-fluid="true" &gt; &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TccWhZ6T8c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VPuKbzP2KNM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DHW0hQHLpTc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="cycle-pager"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--End Responsive Video Slider and Title--&gt; &lt;script&gt; (function() { var body = $('body'); $('.menu-toggle').bind('click', function() { body.toggleClass('menu-open', 'toggle-open'); return false; }); })(); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>CSS</p> <pre><code>body { background-color:black; overflow:scroll; } /*Design for Slide Down menu*/ .menu { overflow:hidden; position:relative; top:0px; -webkit-transition: top 0.8s ease; -moz-transition: top 0.8s ease; transition: top 0.8s ease; } .menu-open { top:231px; } .menu-open .menu-side { top:0px; } .menu-side { background-color:#333; border-bottom:1px solid #000; color:#fff; position:fixed; top:-231px; left:0px; width: 100%; max-width:100%; height: 210px; padding: 10px; -webkit-transition: top 0.8s ease; -moz-transition: top 0.8s ease; transition: top 0.8s ease; } .menu-toggle { position:relative; display:block; width:50px; height:50px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; top:-23.5px; } /*Content style for Menu Side*/ .menu-side ul { width:800px; max-width:100%; height:100px; display:block; text-align:center; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border-style:solid; border-color:white; border-width:thick; -moz-box-shadow:20px 20px 20px 10px black; -webkit-box-shadow:10px 10px 10px 10px 10px black; box-shadow:1px 1px 20px 0.5px black; } .menu-side li { margin-top:auto; margin-bottom:auto; padding:10px; display:inline-block; text-align:center; font-family:Baskerville, "Palatino Linotype", Palatino, "Century Schoolbook L", "Times New Roman", serif; font-size:18px; font-style:italic; } /*Style for Josh Meyers About*/ #Josh-Meyers h1 { text-align:center; color:#FFF; } #Josh-Meyers p { color:#FFF; } /*Style for Video Slide Show and Title*/ #Recent-Projects { text-align:center; height:40px; width:100%; max-width:100%; } #Recent-Projects h1 { text-align:center; color:#FFF; } iframe {max-width:100%} #video-wrapper { width:100%; max-width:100%; height:400px; margin-top:5px; } .cycle-slideshow { width:100%; top:2%; margin-left:auto; max-width:90%; margin-right:auto; } .cycle-prev, .cycle-next { font-size:40px; font-weight:bold; color:#FFF; display:block; position:absolute; top:60%; z-index:999; cursor:pointer; } .cycle-prev {left:2%;} .cycle-next {right:2%;} .cycle-pager { text-align: center; width: 100%; z-index: 999; position: absolute; overflow: hidden; top:85% } .cycle-pager span { font-family: arial; font-size: 50px; width: 16px; height: 16px; display: inline-block; color: #ddd; cursor: pointer; } .cycle-pager span.cycle-pager-active { color: #D69746;} .cycle-pager &gt; * { cursor: pointer;} iframe { padding-left:5px; padding-right:5px; } </code></pre>

123773	0	Is OOP & completely avoiding implementation inheritance possible? <p>I will choose Java as an example, most people know it, though every other OO language was working as well.</p> <p>Java, like many other languages, has interface inheritance and implementation inheritance. E.g. a Java class can inherit from another one and every method that has an implementation there (assuming the parent is not abstract) is inherited, too. That means the interface is inherited and the implementation for this method as well. I can overwrite it, but I don't have to. If I don't overwrite it, I have inherited the implementation.</p> <p>However, my class can also "inherit" (not in Java terms) just an interface, without implementation. Actually interfaces are really named that way in Java, they provide interface inheritance, but without inheriting any implementation, since all methods of an interface have no implementation.</p> <p>Now there was this <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-2003/jw-0801-toolbox.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">article, saying it's better to inherit interfaces than implementations</a>, you may like to read it (at least the first half of the first page), it's pretty interesting. It avoids issues like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_base_class" rel="nofollow noreferrer">fragile base class problem</a>. So far this makes all a lot of sense and many other things said in the article make a lot of sense to me.</p> <p>What bugs me about this, is that implementation inheritance means <strong>code reuse</strong>, one of the most important properties of OO languages. Now if Java had no classes (like James Gosling, the godfather of Java has wished according to this article), it solves all problems of implementation inheritance, but how would you make code reuse possible then?</p> <p>E.g. if I have a class Car and Car has a method move(), which makes the Car move. Now I can sub-class Car for different type of cars, that are all cars, but are all specialized versions of Car. Some may move in a different way, these need to overwrite move() anyway, but most would simply keep the inherited move, as they move alike just like the abstract parent Car. Now assume for a second that there are only interfaces in Java, only interfaces may inherit from each other, a class may implement interfaces, but all classes are always final, so no class can inherit from any other class.</p> <p>How would you avoid that when you have an Interface Car and hundred Car classes, that you need to implement an identical move() method for each of them? What concepts for code reuse other than implementation inheritance exist in the the OO world?</p> <p>Some languages have Mixins. Are Mixins the answer to my question? I read about them, but I cannot really imagine how Mixins would work in a Java world and if they can really solve the problem here.</p> <p>Another idea was that there is a class that only implements the Car interface, let's call it AbstractCar, and implements the move() method. Now other cars implement the Car interface as well, internally they create an instance of AbstractCar and they implement their own move() method by calling move() on their internal abstract Car. But wouldn't this be wasting resources for nothing (a method calling just another method - okay, JIT could inline the code, but still) and using extra memory for keeping internal objects, you wouldn't even need with implementation inheritance? (after all every object needs more memory than just the sum of the encapsulated data) Also isn't it awkward for a programmer to write dummy methods like</p> <pre><code>public void move() { abstractCarObject.move(); } </code></pre> <p>?</p> <p>Anyone can imagine a better idea how to avoid implementation inheritance and still be able to re-use code in an easy fashion?</p>

22672108	1	merging in pandas vs merging in R <p>I'm afraid I do not quite understand the merging capabilities of pandas, although I much prefer python over R for now.</p> <p>In R, I have always been able to merge dataframes very easily as follows:</p> <pre><code>&gt; merge(test,e2s, all.x=T) Gene Mutation Chromosome Entrez 1 AGRN p.R451H chr1 375790 2 C1orf170 p.V663A/V683A chr1 84808 3 HES4 p.R44S chr1 57801 4 ISG15 p.S83N chr1 9636 5 PLEKHN1 p.S476P/S511P/S563P/S76P chr1 84069 </code></pre> <p>However, I have been unable to reconstruct this in pandas with merge(how="left,right,inner,outer")..

19210874	0	PHP/MySQL - Best way to work with dates in DD MMM YYYY format? <p>I need to display dates in the <strong>DD MMM YYYY</strong> format on the website I'm working on. My first thought was to store the dates in a DATE type in MySQL, then convert to the proper format using PHP. However, this is just returning <strong>01 Jan 1970</strong> - not the actual date of <strong>04 May 1891</strong>. </p> <p>I found a few other places where people have asked similar questions and the answer was always something like <code>SELECT date_format(dt, '%d/%m/%Y')</code> which was giving me <strong>04/05/1891</strong>. I want the month to be 3 characters (May, Jun, Jul, Aug, etc).</p> <p>I thought about storing the dates as a VARCHAR but that seems like it would be bad practice. It looks like I will have to store the date as a string and will not be able to use the PHP date() function because it cannot handle dates prior to 1970.</p> <p>I may want to do things like calculate ages which sounds painful when dealing with strings... I am wondering if anyone has a more elegant solution?</p>

29361160	0	How to handle 'half-open' connections- managing client-side socket crash <p>We have a code of Client-Server written in 'C' underlying TCP protocol. The regular socket operations are being performed on both Client and Server. And <code>select()</code> function is being used to monitor multiple connections 'read/ write' mechanisms. The connection has been successfully <code>ESTABLISHED</code>. And using the same <code>select()</code> the connected client sends a message to server for releasing the connection. Up-to this we are happy.</p> <p>The main problem comes when the Client has some issues and has crashed/ stuck-up/ hanged in the middle or because of some other reasons mentioned in here: <a href="http://blog.stephencleary.com/2009/05/detection-of-half-open-dropped.html" rel="nofollow">Detection of Half-Open (Dropped) Connections</a>. The author mentioned about the 'four-way' handshaking! But how can we know the status of the client that has crashed until it sends some signal to Server? Is there a way to know about whether my client is still running (alive) or has some problems (dead) such that the Server closes that particular socket connection that was established? Please let us know. Thank you all... :)</p>
17458933	0	Right way to use md5 secrets in confirming ok-ness of URL requests? When to clear the secret? <p>I have some cases where I need to put a URL into a web page that, when clicked on, will fire some handling code on the server. I obviously want to prevent random bad guys from constructing their own URLs and doing things they shouldn't, so I'm working with this scheme, reverse-engineered from stuff I've seen on other sites:</p> <ul> <li>make a unique string (I'm using MD5, but there doubtless other options)</li> <li>put this string into an appropriately named session variable</li> <li>include the string in the URL, maybe something like <code>/do_this/123/FABDYFYEYYDFBDHDFS</code></li> <li>when the handling code runs, extract the string from the url and compare it to the value of the session variable -- if it matches, we should be safe to proceed. If not, do something else.</li> </ul> <p>This is working OK for me, except for the part where the user's browser's session storage gets littered with no-longer-relevant session variables. There are some cases where I can (and do) delete a session variable once I'm done doing what I'm doing, but not always. I could probably be a little more clever about finding opportunities to clear the old variables, but the problem seems general enough that there may be a better way to do this (i.e., what I've come up with could be really stupid for any number of reasons I haven't thought of). Is there any advice out there for a good/better way of doing this sort of thing?</p>

1738329	0	Should I send retain or autorelease before returning objects? <p>I thought I was doing the right thing here but I get several warnings from the Build and Analyze so now I'm not so sure. My assumption is (a) that an object I get from a function (dateFromComponents: in this case) is already set for autorelease and (b) that what I return from a function should be set for autorelease. Therefore I don't need to send autorelease or retain to the result of the dateFromComponents: before I return it to the caller. Is that right?</p> <p>As a side note, if I rename my function from newTimeFromDate: to gnuTimeFromDate the analyzer does not give any warnings on this function. Is it the convention that all "new*" methods return a retained rather than autoreleased object?</p> <p>In <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmRules.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000994-BAJHFBGH" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Memory Management Programming Guide for Cocoa</a> it says "A received object is normally guaranteed to remain valid within the method it was received" and that "That method may also safely return the object to its invoker." Which leads me to believe my code is correct. </p> <p>However, in <a href="http://oreilly.com/pub/a/mac/excerpt/Cocoa_ch04/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Memory Management in Cocoa</a> it says "Assume that objects obtained by any other method have a retain count of 1 and reside in the autorelease pool.

3434046	0	Problem in M3G rendering in J2ME <p>I have made 3 planes and positioned them in a way that they make a corner of cube. (For some reasons I don't want to make a cube object). The 3 planes have 3 different Texture2Ds with different images. The strange problem is when I render the 3 objects and start rotating the camera, in some perspectives some parts of these 3 planes don't get rendered. For example when I look straight at the corner a hole is created which is shaped as a triangle. This is the image of the problem in a netbeans emulator: <img src="http://www.pegahan.com/m3g.jpg" alt="alt text"> I put the red lines there so you can see the cube better. The other strange thing is that the problem resolves when I set the scale of the objects to 0.5 or less. By the way the camera is in its default position and the cube's center is at (0,0,0) and each plane has a width and height of 2. Does anyone have any ideas why these objects have a conflict with each other and how could I resolve this problem.</p> <p>Thanks in advance</p>

3734371	0	How to avoid cyclic behaviour with Castle Windsor's CollectionResolver? <p>I am using Castle Windsor 2.5 in my application. I have a service which is a composite that acts as a distributor for objects that implement the same interface.</p> <pre><code>public interface IService { void DoStuff(string someArg); } public class ConcreteService1 : IService { public void DoStuff(string someArg) { } } public class ConcreteService2 : IService { public void DoStuff(string someArg) { } } public class CompositeService : List&lt;IService&gt;, IService { private readonly IService[] decoratedServices; CompositeService(params IService[] decoratedServices) { this.decoratedServices = decoratedServices; } public void DoStuff(string someArg) { foreach (var service in decoratedServices) { service.DoStuff(someArg); } } } </code></pre> <p>The problem I have is that using config such as that shown below causes Windsor to report that "A cycle was detected when trying to resolve a dependency."</p> <pre><code>windsor.Register( Component .For&lt;IService&gt;() .ImplementedBy&lt;CompositeService&gt;(), Component .For&lt;IService&gt;() .ImplementedBy&lt;ConcreteService1&gt;(), Component .For&lt;IService&gt;() .ImplementedBy&lt;ConcreteService2&gt;() ); </code></pre> <p>This cyclic behaviour seems to be at odds with the standard (non-collection based) behaviour that can be used to implenent the decorator pattern, where the component being resolved is ignored and the next registered component that implements the same interface is used instead.</p> <p>So what I'd like to know is whether or not there is a way to make Windsor exclude the <code>CompositeService</code> component when it's resolving the <code>IService</code> services for the <code>decoratedServices</code> property. The <code>decoratedServices</code> property should contain two items: an instance of <code>ConcreteService1</code>, and an instance of <code>ConcreteService2</code>. I'd like to do this without explicitly specifying the dependencies.</p>

In other words, it doesn't add or delete any of these files locally (what I presume <code>local add/delete</code> means).

One of my team members is working on a service that receives un-encrypted messages directly from a FIX gateway in Tokyo to an app server in London, via our WAN. The London end always initiates the authenticated connection, and at no point do these messages leave our WAN. </p> <p>But our local security guru suggests that we should be encrypting these messages as a <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=216403220" rel="nofollow noreferrer">WAN apparently has significantly more security risk than a LAN</a>. How much easier is it really to break into a WAN than a LAN? And what other security risks does a WAN pose in this context?</p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Many thanks for your answers. I've decided to encrypt the connection, mainly because it's clear that the WAN does introduce extra security vulnerabilities due to the hardware being outside of our physical control. </p>

10781084	0	If my app deletes a post it made to a user's wall, will all likes and shares made by other people also be deleted? <p>Lets say I have a FB app I've created, and for whatever reason the server code for the app is responsible for posting stories to the app user's wall (using a token).</p> <p>Now let's say we want to take down that post at a later date - easy, right? Because the app created the post, it owns it, and using the ID it received originally it can take that post down. (I presume the ID I get back is actually an "object id" referring to my content, rather than specifically to the post on the user's wall - correct?)</p> <p>Here's the thing though. What if one or more friends of the user shared that story to their own wall - what if this happened a number of times, spreading through the friend relationship tree further and further. Does my app still have the power to remove all of these posts, because it created the original post?</p> <p>Additionally, what if the original user deleted the post themselves from their wall, but not until it had been shared by his/her friends? Would this have the same effect (delete everywhere), or would it only be that one specific post being removed? Would my app get an error when it tried to delete the post itself if the post had already been deleted by the user? </p> <p>The reason I ask is because, if my app deleted the original post that it made to the user's wall, I would want <em>all</em> of the shared posts or likes to also be deleted, no matter where they were down the friend chain. I don't want to delete my original post and assume all is well, only to discover that because it was shared several times down the chain that it is still visible somewhere. </p> <p>In case it's relevant, the "post" my app will make would require a custom image and a specific return URL - I tried the <code>/user_id/links</code> graph API and it didnt work (there's a bug with it).

28241767	0	CSS content of input value before the input in a td element <p>I have to print a pretty hefty page / form / table combination and when I print I have multiple text input elements that I can't seem to reduce the width to use only the width needed to display the text without excess width. That excess width effects the <em>ten required columns</em> I have to print.</p> <p>So I've attempted to use CSS Content to move the text from the text input elements in to the parent table data elements.

28714815	0	Calculating CRC initial value instead of appending the CRC to payload <p>Most of the CRCs I've implemented were <strong>appending</strong> the calculated CRC value to the message (payload) and checking for a zero result at the receiver after all bytes incl. CRC value were fed through the CRC register. Obviously this is a quite standard approach.</p> <p>Now I would like to use a different approach:</p> <ol> <li>Calculate a value from the payload.</li> <li>Use that value as initial value for the CRC register <strong>before</strong> the message bytes (payload) are fed through the CRC register such that the result after the last byte of the payload was fed through will be zero.</li> </ol> <p>What is the best approach to do this? Does one have a good idea or some pointers where to dig deeper?</p> <p>ps: Why I want to do this? In some applications (ROM) I cannot append data as the data is stored at the end of address space of a ROM. So I'd like to either preload the CRC register or prepend the value to the message.</p>

3337441	0	MySQL - Searching in a multiple value field <p>In my database table I have the following fields:</p> <p>Table Supplier:</p> <ul> <li>id</li> <li>name</li> <li>vehicles</li> </ul> <p>A supplier can have multiple vehicles. The field 'vehicles' will store multiple values. At the moment I am delimiting the values on a 'pipe' symbol, although this can be changed to a comma if need be.</p> <p>On my front-end form I have a checkbox list - a user can select multiple vehicles. The back end script needs to do a search and bring back all suppliers that contain any of the specified vehicle id's.</p> <p>So in other words we are searching with multiple values in a multiple value field.</p> <p>The checkbox list name is vehicle_type[] and will end up in the $_POST array as (for example):</p> <pre><code>Array ( [0] =&gt; 1 [1] =&gt; 4 [2] =&gt; 6 ) </code></pre> <p>Is this possible to do? I could obviously do this using a join table but ideally I would like to do it this way. I am using PHP as my scripting language if that helps.</p>

To speed things up massively I used Windows OLE but I've come across an interesting issue where the the <code>ar2</code> OLE object has a method called <code>size</code> but calling it gives me error <code>800A004C</code> or "Path Not Found". I have also tested on other directories and the below code works perfectly fine.</p> <p>I have used the method <code>ole_methods</code> and double checked the casing on <code>size</code>. The OLE method in Ruby definitely exists but no dice on getting it to succeed.</p> <p>Why is Windows OLE throwing this error when it should know the folder exists and compute the overall size of the folder structure recursively?</p> <pre><code>require 'win32ole' def getFileCount(dir) size = dir.Files.count sub_folders = dir.SubFolders unless sub_folders == 0 sub_folders.each do |sub| size += getFileCount(sub) end end size end AR2_NAME = ARGV[0] FSO = WIN32OLE.new("Scripting.FileSystemObject") ar2 = FSO.GetFolder(AR2_NAME) ar2_file_count = getFileCount(ar2) puts "Stats for #{ar2.path}.\n\n" puts "Total file count: #{ar2_file_count}." puts "Total size: #{ar2.size}." </code></pre> <p>Run the file using </p> <pre><code>Ruby C:\sample.rb "C:\my_folder" </code></pre> <p>Here's the error in question:</p> <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WNn3t.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WNn3t.png" alt="The error in question"></a></p> <p>The folder's size is 1,492,503,618,641 bytes (1.35 TB) according to Windows. It is over 100k files.</p> <p>I have included my recursive file counting method as this works and illustrates that my folder does indeed exist.</p>

(I will play multiple streams). </p> <p>1) It's enough to use <code>wavePlayer.Volume = volumeSlider1.Volume;</code>? It is deprecated.</p> <p>2) I see that <code>AudioFileReader</code> make use of <code>SampleChannel</code> for Volume control. If i rewrite Read method for <code>RawSourceWaveStream</code> and add Volume Property should this be a good solution?</p> <p>3) I want playback time estimation as best as possible (at millisecond level). I saw that the time resolution of <code>WaveOutEvent</code> is about hundred of milliseconds. The time resolution of <code>DirectSoundOut</code> is better, but still not enough.</p> <p>Thank you in advance!</p>

2949221	0	How to find unmapped properties in a NHibernate mapped class? <p>I just had a NHibernate related problem where I forgot to map one property of a class.</p> <p>A very simplified example:</p> <pre><code>public class MyClass { public virtual int ID { get; set; } public virtual string SomeText { get; set; } public virtual int SomeNumber { get; set; } } </code></pre> <p>...and the mapping file:</p> <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt; &lt;hibernate-mapping xmlns="urn:nhibernate-mapping-2.2" assembly="MyAssembly" namespace="MyAssembly.MyNamespace"&gt; &lt;class name="MyClass" table="SomeTable"&gt; &lt;property name="ID" /&gt; &lt;property name="SomeText" /&gt; &lt;/class&gt; &lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt; </code></pre> <p>In this simple example, you can see the problem at once:<br> there is a property named "SomeNumber" in the class, but not in the mapping file.<br> So NHibernate will not map it and it will always be zero.</p> <p>The real class had a lot more properties, so the problem was not as easy to see and it took me quite some time to figure out why SomeNumber always returned zero even though I was 100% sure that the value in the database was != zero.</p> <p><strong>So, here is my question:</strong> </p> <p>Is there some simple way to find this out via NHibernate?<br> Like a compiler warning when a class is mapped, but some of its properties are not.<br> Or some query that I can run that shows me unmapped properties in mapped classes...you get the idea.</p> <p>(Plus, it would be nice if I could exclude some legacy columns that I <em>really</em> don't want mapped.)</p> <p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br> Okay, I looked at everything you proposed and decided to go with the meta-data API...that looks the easiest to understand for me.<br> Now that I know what to search for, I found some examples which helped me to get started.<br> So far, I have this:</p> <pre><code>Type type = typeof(MyClass); IClassMetadata meta = MySessionFactory.GetClassMetadata(type); PropertyInfo[] infos = type.GetProperties(); foreach (PropertyInfo info in infos) { if (meta.PropertyNames.Contains(info.Name)) { Console.WriteLine("{0} is mapped!", info.Name); } else { Console.WriteLine("{0} is not mapped!", info.Name); } } </code></pre> <p>It nearly works, except one thing: IClassMetadata.PropertyNames returns the names of all the properties <strong>except</strong> the ID.<br> To get the ID, I have to use IClassMetadata.IdentifierPropertyName. </p> <p>Yes, I could save .PropertyNames in a new array, add .IdentifierPropertyName to it and search <em>that</em> array.<br> But this looks strange to me.<br> Is there no better way to get <strong>all</strong> mapped properties including the ID?</p>

21810145	0	Paypal checkout opens on a separate tab - how to change this? <p>I have found that the Paypal generated buttons is a very good solution for my wife's website. However, whenever someone presses on the "add to cart" button, he/she is taken to a separate Internet Explorer tab. That's fine. However, if they chose to "continue shopping", IE tries to close the Paypal tab and asks the user's permission to do so. This is not really ideal from the user experience point of view.</p> <p>Can I force the Paypal Checkout to open in the same IE tab as the main website?</p> <p>Thank you.</p>

I was (and still am) new to git, but I happily created a few branches, occasionally merging them with the changes from the remote source. I have also pushed my changes every now and again to my remote forked version of the repo, but I never pushed much to the original repo, because my work was undone and nobody demanded it.</p> <p>Here is the situation: I have a whole load of changes committed and pushed to my remote repo. Almost none of it made it to the original remote repo that the rest of the group is working on. Just doing one big diff is out of the question, because there is still way too much scruffy unfinished work that nobody besides me might need. How do I start pushing selected changes (as in, selected manually, by hand) to the remote repo, chunk by chunk?</p> <p>I am not fluent in git, and I wonder if I have to make a clean clone and start from there. Is there a smarter way of approaching my situation?</p> <p>Thank you.</p>

25698830	0	Programatically reading iOS app .crash file? <p>As per my understanding, when an iOS app crashes, the system creates a .crash file that can be accessed through XCode. Is it possible to read this file programatically from within the app itself?</p> <p>My intention is to send this crash log (if exists) to a server so that we can analyse the log without user intervention. There are several crash reporting services (e.g. bugsense, crashlytics) that are able to do this, so I assume a custom implementation should be possible?</p> <p>Cheers!</p>
33312748	0	why dont IDE's offer built in code timing like break points? <p>I find timing my code for performance to be a bit of a headache and I have to assume this is a common problem for folks.</p> <p>Adding in a bunch of code to time my loops is great but often there is more overhead in adding the timing checks than adding a parallel task. making a loop parallel can take seconds whereas adding in timing chunks requires several lines of code and be dangerous if forgotten.</p> <p>So... My question is why dont IDE's include this ability to time chunks of code like a break point? Something like i mark a section of code and tell it to dump the timing output to a console with some options to make it more readable. averages and such.</p> <p>I know break points can seriously hamper performance but there must be an easier way to time specific chunks of code then to write all my own timing routines for each chunk of code i want to check. </p>

1467968	0	Classes in different sub-namespaces all appear at top level in WSDL <p>I'm creating a web service with a variety of classes, many of which can contain references to other classes. Sometimes these "sub classes" have the same name (e.g. Customer and Customer), but are actually different, so I've placed these in different namespaces (e.g. MyRoot.Sub1, MyRoot.Sub2, etc.)</p> <p>When I build the service, the generated WSDL places all of these classes at the top level, without specifying any delineation by sub-namespace. Therefore, it will define two versions of "Customer". Curiously, it doesn't complain during the build process.</p> <p>When I host the service and try to reference it with a browser, I get the following error:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The top XML element 'Customer' from</em> <em>namespace 'RE: http://...' references</em> <em>distinct types MyRoot.Sub1.Customer</em> <em>and MyRoot.Sub2.Customer. Use XML</em> <em>attributes to specify another XML name</em> <em>or namespace for the element or types.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I looks like I could use XmlTypeAttribute TypeName to provide an unique class name, but this makes documentation quite a hassle, as everything's going to have two names. Considering the differentiation is already specified by the namespaces, is there any way to utilize that information? I haven't tried using TypeName="Sub1.Customer", etc., but none of the examples that I've seen use this notation, so I'm skeptical.</p> <p>Is there something else obvious that I'm missing?</p>

29265555	0	managed_file form element doesn't render correctly <p>I have a simple managed file form element that is the only element in my form. It looks like this:</p> <pre><code>$form['upload'] = array( '#type' =&gt; 'managed_file', '#title' =&gt; t('Select a YML file'), '#progress_message' =&gt; t('Please wait...'), '#progress_indicator' =&gt; 'bar', '#description' =&gt; t('Click "Browse..." to select a file to upload.'), '#required' =&gt; TRUE, '#upload_validators' =&gt; array('file_validate_extensions' =&gt; array('yml txt docx')), '#upload_location' =&gt; $upload_dest, ); </code></pre> <p>When I render the form using the drupal_get_form callback in hook_menu I get a perfectly formed managed_file upload field with the browse and upload buttons. Things change when I decide I want to add a table of information underneath the form. This requires building a table using theme functions then adding that to the form by rendering the form and appending the table. I create my table and add it to the form:</p> <pre><code>$rows = array(); foreach($yml_files as $yml_file){ $rows[] = array($yml_file-&gt;uri, $yml_file-&gt;filename); } $output = drupal_render($form['upload']); $output .= theme('table', array('header'=&gt;$header, 'rows'=&gt;$rows)); return $output; </code></pre> <p>When I generate the form using drupal_render, I get the nice help text, but no upload form. The table renders fine in both scenarios and I'm not seeing any errors.</p> <p>If Drupal uses drupal_render to render its forms why would the form look different in the second scnenario? Is there a way to get the entire form? I've tried a variety of ways of passing the form and using dpm to print the form at various stages and I'm not sure where to go from here.</p> <p>Standard file upload fields render correctly as do other form elements. It seems to be limited to the managed_file element.</p>

10867437	1	finding the area of a closed 2d uniform cubic B-spline <p>I have a list of 2d points which are the control vertices (Dx) for a closed uniform cubic B-spline. I am assuming a simple curve (non-self-intersecting, all control points are distinct).</p> <p>I am trying to find the area enclosed by the curve:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Vlf1.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>If I calculate the knot points (Px), I can treat the curve as a polygon; then I "just" need to find the remaining delta areas, for each segment, between the actual curve and the straight line joining the knot points.</p> <p>I understand that the shape (and therefore area) of a Bspline is invariant under rotation and translation - so for each segment, I can find a translation to put the t=0 knot at the origin and a rotation to put the t=1 knot on the +x axis:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oGwCS.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>I can find the equation for the curve by plugging the points in and re-grouping:</p> <pre><code>P(t) = ( (t**3)*(-Dm1 + 3*D0 - 3*D1 + D2) + (t**2)*(3*Dm1 - 6*D0 + 3*D1) + t*(-3*Dm1 + 3*D1) + (Dm1 + 4*D0 + D1) ) / 6. </code></pre> <p>but I'm tearing my hair out trying to integrate it - I can do</p> <pre><code> 1 / | Py(t) dt / t=0 </code></pre> <p>but that doesn't give me area. I <em>think</em> what I need is</p> <pre><code> Px(t=1) / | Py(t) (dPx(t) / dt) dt / x = Px(t=0) </code></pre> <p>but before I go further, I'd really like to know:</p> <ol> <li><p>Is this the correct calculation for area? Ideally, an analytic solution would make my day!</p></li> <li><p>Once I find this area, how can I tell whether I need to add or subtract it from the base poly (red vs green areas in the first diagram)?</p></li> <li><p>Are there any Python modules which would do this calculation for me? Numpy has some methods for evaluating cubic Bsplines, but none which seem to deal with area.</p></li> <li><p>Is there an easier way to do this? I am thinking about maybe evaluating P(t) at a bunch of points - something like <code>t = numpy.arange(0.0, 1.0, 0.05)</code> - and treating the whole thing as a polygon. Any idea how many subdivisions are needed to guarantee a given level of accuracy (I'd like error &lt; 1%)?</p></li> </ol>

743094	0	App_Data/ASPNETDB.MDF to Sql Server 2005 (or 08) <p>I've been developing an ASP.NET WebForms app that needed account login functionality (e.g. register new users, change passwords, recover passwords, profiles, roles, etc). To do this, I used FormsAuthentication with the default data store, which, to my surprise, is an MDF file in App_Data. When it comes time to actually deploy this app. live on the web, I'm going to use some shared hosting like GoDaddy or another cheap company.</p> <p>For efficiency, I'd like to switch over from this MDF to actual SQL Server 2005 or 2008 (who in their right mind uses flat files?). With shared hosting, however, I'm not going to be able to run any programs like aspnet_regsql.exe. I'll just have a single login and password to a SQL Server database, and an FTP account into the domain root. No MSTSC remote desktop, no console access, no tinkering in IIS, etc.</p> <p>I won't need to transfer any user accounts from ASPNETDB.MDF (site will be starting with zero users), but how am I suppose to:</p> <p>1) Easily create the tables, procedures, etc. that Visual Studio automatically created in ASPNETDB.MDF when I used Web Site Administration Tool to get started with FormsAuthentication?</p> <p>2) Have the SQL membership provider use a connection string I give it instead of using whatever it is now to connect to this ASPNETDB.MDF. Hell, I don't even see any connection string to this MDF in the web.config; how the hell is my app. even finding it? Machine.config? That would be a poor decision if that's the case. This behind-the-scenes crap drives me nuts.</p> <p><strong>Any help from someone who has been through this migration would be very, very much appreciated!</strong></p>

1487194	0	Subclasses causing unexpected behavior in superclasses — OO design question <p>Although I'm coding in ObjC, This question is intentionally language-agnostic - it should apply to most OO languages</p> <p>Let's say I have an "Collection" class, and I want to create a "FilteredCollection" that inherits from "Collection". Filters will be set up at object-creation time, and from them on, the class will behave like a "Collection" with the filters applied to its contents.</p> <p>I do things the obvious way and subclass Collection. I override all the accessors, and think I've done a pretty neat job - my FilteredCollection looks like it should behave just like a Collection, but with objects that are 'in' it that correspond to my filters being filtered out to users. I think I can happily create FilteredCollections and pass them around my program as Collections.</p> <p>But I come to testing and - oh no - it's not working. Delving into the debugger, I find that it's because the Collection implementation of some methods is calling the overridden FilteredCollection methods (say, for example, there's a "count" method that Collection relies upon when iterating its objects, but now it's getting the filtered count, because I overrode the count method to give the correct external behaviour).</p> <p>What's wrong here? Why does it feel like some important principles are being violated despite the fact that it also feels like OO 'should' work this way? What's a general solution to this issue? Is there one?</p> <p>I know, by the way, that a good 'solution' to this problem in particular would be to filter the objects before I put them into the collection, and not have to change Collection at all, but I'm asking a more general question than that - this is just an example. The more general issue is methods in an opaque superclass that rely on the behaviour of other methods that could be changed by subclasses, and what to do in the case that you want to subclass an object to change behaviour like this.</p>

If you take a closer look at the string cmdToExecute, you can see the option o with value XYZ enclosed in SINGLE QUOTE. There is a reason that this needs to be given in single quote orelse my tool TRAPTOOL will not be able to process the command.</p> <p>I am using subprocess.Popen to execute the entire command. Before executing my command in a shell, I am printing the content</p> <pre><code>print "Cmd to be exectued: %r" % cmdToExecute myProcess = subprocess.Popen(cmdToExecute, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=False) (stdOut, stdErr) = myProcess.communicate() </code></pre> <p>The output of the above command is, Cmd to be executed: TRAPTOOL -a STRING "ABC" -o \'XYZ\'.</p> <p>You can see that the output shows a BACKWARD SLASH added automatically while printing. Actually, the \ is not there in the string, which I tested using a regex. But, when the script is run on my box, the TRAPTOOL truncates the part of the string XYZ on the receiving server. I manually copy pasted the print output and tried sending it, I saw the same error on the receiving server. However, when I removed the backward slash, it sent the trap without any truncation.</p> <ol> <li>Can anyone say why this happens?</li> <li>Is there anyway where we can see what command is actually executed in subprocess.Popen?</li> <li>Is there any other way I can execute my command other that subprocess.Popen that might solve this problem?</li> </ol>

28686099	0	Why NOP/few extra lines of code/optimization of pointer aliasing helps? [Fujitsu MB90F543 MCU C code] <p>I am trying to fix an bug found in a mature program for Fujitsu MB90F543. The program works for nearly 10 years so far, but it was discovered, that under some special circumstances it fails to do two things at it's very beginning. One of them is crucial.</p> <p>After low and high level initialization (ports, pins, peripherials, IRQ handlers) configuration data is read over SPI from EEPROM and status LEDs are turned on for a moment (to turn them a data is send over SPI to a LED driver). When those special circumstances occur first and only first function invoking just a few EEPROM reads fails and additionally a few of the LEDs that should, don't turn on.</p> <p>The program is written in C and compiled using Softune v30L32. Surprisingly it is sufficient to add single __asm(" NOP ") in low level hardware init to make the program work as expected under mentioned circumstances. It is sufficient to turn off 'Control optimization of pointer aliasing' in Optimization settings. Adding just a few lines of code in various places helps too.</p> <p>I have compared (DIFFed) ASM listings of compiled program for a version with and without __asm(" NOP ") and with both aforementioned optimizer settings and they all look just fine.</p> <p>The only warning Softune compiler has been printing for years during compilation is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>*** W1372L: The section is placed outside the RAM area or the I/O area (IOXTND)</p> </blockquote> <p>I do realize it's rather general question, but maybe someone who has a bigger picture will be able to point out possible cause. </p> <p>Have you got an idea what may cause such a weird behaviour? How to locate the bug and fix it?</p> <p>During the initialization a few long (about 20ms) delay loops are used. They don't help although they were increased from about 2ms, yet single NOP in any line of the hardware initialization function and even before or after the function helps.</p> <p>Both the wait loops works. I have checked it using an oscilloscope. (I have added LED turn on before and off after).</p> <p>I have checked timming hypothesis by slowing down SPI clock from 1MHz to 500kHz. It does not change anything. Slowing down to 250kHz makes watchdog resets, as some parts of the code execute too long (>25ms).</p> <p>One more thing. I have observed that adding local variables in any source file sometimes makes the problem disappear or reappear. The same concerns initializing uninitialized local variables. Adding a few extra lines of a code in any of the files helps or reveals the problem.</p> <pre><code>void main(void) { watchdog_init(); // waiting for power supply to stabilize wait; // about 45ms hardware_init(); clear_watchdog(); application_init(); clear_watchdog(); wait; // about 20ms test_LED(); {...} } void hardware_init (void) { __asm("NOP"); // how it comes it helps? - it may be in any line of the function io_init(); // ports initialization clk_init(); timer_init(); adc_init(); spi_init(); LED_init(); spi_start(); key_driver_init(); can_init(); irq_init(); // set IRQ priorities and global IRQ enable } </code></pre>

556091	0	OnReadyStateChange event in ActiveX controls <p>I wrote a Firefox plugin (only compatible with FF3 atm) that allows the hosting of ActiveX controls.<br> Before the flaming begins - this is not the main topic for this question and the plugin was designed with security in mind so it doesn't break my favorite browser. if you are interested, it's hosted at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ff-activex-host/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://code.google.com/p/ff-activex-host/</a>.</p> <p>Now, I've noticed that in IE all ActiveX controls have an event called OnReadyStateChange available, however, not all ActiveX controls have that event listed in their TypeLib. As a result, my plugin cannot register handlers for this event for every ActiveX control.</p> <p>Opening such controls with OleView, I can't find the OnReadyStateChange event either - leading me to believe that IE might be 'cheating' here to make it work. When OleView shows such a handler (as with the Shockwave ActiveX control), I have no troubles registering handlers for it.</p> <p>An example of such a control is Microsoft's Terminal Services ActiveX. But it's not a problem limited to MS ActiveX controls.</p> <p>I am not an expert on COM Objects, am I searching for the event in a wrong way or at the wrong place?<br> Right Now I think I'm doing it right, since OleView can't find it either, so...</p> <p>Can I somehow 'cheat' the same way IE does and make this event available anyway?</p>

I am now taking a class that requires me to program in C++ and I would like to use VS as the IDE. I uninstalled VS 2012 and upgraded to 2013. I am able to compile c# code but when I make a c++ project I get the error </p> <blockquote> <p>error LNK1104: cannot open file 'SDL.lib'</p> </blockquote> <p>I went to the project properties -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> input and made sure that SDL was not referenced there. My Additional Dependencies now has the value %(AdditionalDependencies). The rest of the options are blank. I also made sure that in VC++ Directories the Include Directories did not include anything related to SDL. Having done all of this I still get the same error. Is is somehow inheriting the SDL linker. The project only contains a hello world program which does not include any other libraries. Any help is appreciated. </p>

15394450	0	onDraw() not being called <p>I am working on fixing someone's Android app. It was originally made for 2.1 and I am trying to get it work to 4.0+. Unfortunately the person who made the app is not around so I am stuck with his code.</p> <p>The app implements custom sliders, a horizontal and vertical. I got the vertical slider fixed, but I cannot get the horizontal slider to work. It is not calling <code>onDraw()</code>: When the view loads, <code>onDraw()</code> gets called and I see both of my sliders initialized, then when I move my horizontal slider it moves and calls <code>onDraw()</code> once, but never again will it call it, unlike the vertical slider which does call it.</p> <p>Here is the code:</p> <pre><code>public class PanSeekBar extends RelativeLayout { private RelativeLayout layout1;

8982416	0	How to publish Actions to Facebook Graph API with parameters in call URL <p>To begin, Ive spent several hours looking for an answer and have come CLOSE but havent found a full answer.</p> <p>So Im trying to publish actions using Facebook's Graph API and want to send parameters in the URL when initially calling it with the Facebook Javascript SDK.</p> <p>Here is a call that WORKS:</p> <pre><code> function postNewAction() { passString = '&amp;object=http://mysite.com/appnamespace/object.php'; FB.api('/me/APP_NAMESPACE:ACTION' + passString,'post', function(response) { if (!response || response.error) { alert(response.error.message); } else { alert('Post was successful! Action ID: ' + response.id); } } ); } </code></pre> <p>With object.php looking like so:</p> <pre><code> &lt;head xmlns:enemysearch="http://apps.facebook.com/APP_NAMESPACE/ns#"&gt; &lt;meta property="fb:app_id" content="APP_ID" /&gt; &lt;meta property="og:type" content="APP_NAMESPACE:object" /&gt; &lt;meta property="og:title" content="some title" /&gt; &lt;meta property="og:description" content="some description"/&gt; &lt;meta property="og:locale" content="en_US" /&gt; &lt;meta property="og:url" content="http://www.mysite.com/appnamespace/object.php"/&gt; &lt;/head&gt; </code></pre> <p>So obviously the above will post some sort of action to Facebook that will be the same every time object.php is called.</p> <p>This is not ideal for my purposes.</p> <p>So I took a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8431694/dynamic-generation-of-facebook-open-graph-meta-tags">this thread</a> and it helped but as you will see, doesnt answer everything.</p> <p>So if I change object.php to include dynamically generated meta tags by using content from either GET or POST and use the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug" rel="nofollow">Object Debugger</a> with a matching URL format to the one provided in og:url, the debugger shows everything as working as I would expect with now warnings. Here is what the dynamically generated object.php looks like:</p> <pre><code> &lt;?php if(count($_GET) &gt; 0) { $userName = (int)$_GET['userName']; } else { $userName = (int)$_POST['userName']; } ?&gt; &lt;head xmlns:enemysearch="http://apps.facebook.com/APP_NAMESPACE/ns#"&gt; &lt;meta property="fb:app_id" content="APP_ID" /&gt; &lt;meta property="og:type" content="APP_NAMESPACE:object" /&gt; &lt;meta property="og:title" content=" &lt;?php echo $userName; ?&gt;" /&gt; &lt;meta property="og:description" content="Click to view more from &lt;?php echo $userName; ?&gt;"/&gt; &lt;meta property="og:locale" content="en_US" /&gt; &lt;meta property="og:url" content="http://mysite.com/appnamespace/object.php?userName=&lt;?php echo $userName; ?&gt;"/&gt; &lt;/head&gt; </code></pre> <p>SO, what I need to know is how to send url parameters in the initial call. If I use the debugger and enter something to the effect of <a href="http://mysite.com/appnamespace/object.php?userName=Brad" rel="nofollow">http://mysite.com/appnamespace/object.php?userName=Brad</a> everything works fine and the meta tags return content with that name inside of them. However if I try to pass the same url in the Javascript Call, it returns an error saying that my meta property og:type needs to be 'APP_NAMESPACE:object' (which as you see above, is what I have) instead of 'website' (which as you can see above, is something I am not using). Here is what that broken call would look like:</p> <pre><code> function postNewAction(userName) { passString = '&amp;object=http://mysite.com/appnamespace/object.php?userName=' + userName; FB.api('/me/APP_NAMESPACE:ACTION' + passString,'post', function(response) { if (!response || response.error) { alert(response.error.message); } else { alert('Post was successful! Action ID: ' + response.id); } } ); } </code></pre> <p>To be clear, the userName variable is only for example.</p> <p>Any thoughts?</p>

10263001	0	jquery form validation using groups <p>I have an order form, one part of the form is the address. It contains Company, Street-Address, ZIP, Town, Country with a simple jquery form validation with every field required, and ZIP validated for number. Now what I want is to group them and only have one field showing "valid address" on success, or "address wrong" on error.</p> <p>This is a part of my js code:</p> <pre><code>$("#pageform").validate( { messages: { company_from: addressError, //addressError is a JS var for the error message street_from: addressError, zip_from: addressError, town_from: addressError, country_from: addressError }, groups: { from: "company_from street_from zip_from town_from country_from" }, errorPlacement: function(error, element) { if (element.attr("name") == "company_from" || element.attr("name") == "street_from" || element.attr("name") == "zip_from" || element.attr("name") == "town_from" || element.attr("name") == "country_from" ) { $("#error_from").append(error); } }, success: function(label) { var attribute = $(label[0]).attr("for"); $(".err-ok-" + attribute + " .ok").css("display", "block").css("visibility", "visible"); } } ); </code></pre> <p>This is a part of the corresponding HTML code:</p> <pre><code>&lt;input type="text" name="company_from" id="company_from" class="required default input-s8" maxlength="255" /&gt; &lt;input type="text" name="street_from" id="street_from" class="required default input-s8" maxlength="255" /&gt; &lt;input type="text" name="zip_from" id="zip_from" class="required digits default input-s8" maxlength="5" onblur="checkCalculation()" /&gt; &lt;input type="text" name="town_from" id="town_from" class="required default input-s8" maxlength="255" /&gt; &lt;!-- and a select list for the country --&gt; </code></pre> <p>You do not need to take a closer look on how I show the error and so on, my problem is, that <strong>I do not know when to show the error label and when the success label</strong>. When I enter a letter for the ZIP code, my errorPlacement function and the success function is called (and the errorPlacement first), so I guess it's always calling the success if there is at least one field correct. </p> <p>Please ask if there are any questions, and I am pretty sure there are... :-)</p>

In the <code>serializeUser()</code> <code>done(null, user.id)</code> something happens. I've tried stepping through it, but what I end up getting into seems fairly obfuscated (or I'm too dumb to understand it) so I can't tell what's actually happening. </p>

So I'll base my question around the actual gem from the tutorial itself.</p> <p>If you bundle the exact gem from the tutorial (the gem is named <code>hola</code>) into a rails application and try to use the executable command <code>hola</code>, all you get are error messages:</p> <pre><code>$ rails hola spanish # =&gt; Error: Command 'hola' not recognized $ ruby hola spanish # =&gt; ruby: No such file or directory -- hola (LoadError) $ hola spanish # =&gt; -bash: hola: command not found </code></pre> <p>Even if I attempt to execute the command this way it doesn't seem to work:</p> <pre><code>$ ruby -Ilib ./bin/hola spanish # =&gt; ruby: No such file or directory -- ./bin/hola (LoadError) </code></pre> <p>The only time this seems to execute anything is when I'm inside the actual gem directory recreated by hand in the tutorial and type this:</p> <pre><code>$ ruby -Ilib ./bin/hola spanish # =&gt; hola mundo </code></pre> <p>But this is useless because the whole point of creating an executable is to be able to execute it within an actual project not the gem directory (ie: someone downloading your gem and being able to use it with a single executable keyword, like <code>rake routes</code> which then does something).</p> <p>Can I bundle the <code>hola</code> gem from this official rubygems.org tutorial and use it as an executable in the way I was expecting to execute it, like this:</p> <pre><code>$ hola spanish # =&gt; hola mundo </code></pre> <p>If this is possible, how is it done?</p>

12403797	0	IIS ARR (edge) cache (reverse proxy) - Upstream connection timeout issue <p>I am looking to use the IIS Application Request Routing as a reverse proxy cache. I've looked at several different options and come to the conclusion that it fits my needs the best. However, I've run into a sort of a dead end and could really use some input from someone who has more experience with the ARR module.</p> <p>I have the following setup:</p> <ul> <li>IIS ARR cache proxying requests to an internal server farm (weighted round robin loadbalancing to use the nearest origin server).</li> <li>Keep alive is disabled in the IIS proxies.</li> <li>The server farm consists of nginx webservers.</li> <li>The IIS servers have RAM disk caches.</li> </ul> <p>The use case is such that the edge servers will receive byte range requests and as it serves the content to the end user it will cache it (first 60 sec in memory cache, then write it to the RAM disk). So far everything is working correctly but when the next end user starts requesting the same byte ranges (that are now in the cache) I'm starting so see some weird behaviour between the IIS edges and the nginx origins: Upon the first byte range request (by the second end user) the IIS server opens a connection to the nginx origin which it does not use because it already has the requested segments in the cache. Since the connection isn't being used it's eventually closed by nginx due to a timeout (60 seconds). In the mean time the second end user is still requesting segments of the file that are in the cache. Then, and this is where the issue occurs, the second end user gets to a point in the file which is not in the cache. The behaviour I would expect from IIS here (being that keep-alive is disabled) is that it would open up a new connection to the origin and start fetching the part of the file that isn't in the cache. The behaviour I'm seeing however is that IIS tries to reuse the same connection it opened up in the beginning of the request (without realizing that it's been dropped by the origin). I've used the "Failed request tracing" to verify this as well and the result of that is that the IIS doesn't get an expected reply from the origin (since the connection no longer exists) and then, in turn, returns a 502.3 to the end user.</p> <p>I've verified that increasing the connection timeout on the origins will "solve" the problem, but that is not really a viable solution as I would basically have to set an infinite timeout which may cause a whole new set of problems on the origin side. Is there any way of controlling how IIS handles this upstream connection (i.e. force it to open a new connection when it actually needs data from the origin, or to have it realize that the origin closed the connection)?</p>
9093419	0	Accessing a variable from a file through a file that is required in said first file <p>I have an osCommerce-shop where I need to access a variable from inside an included php-file. For the sake of simplicity here is a short example of what I am talking about without anything related to osCommerce:</p> <p>The file inside.php shows a picture and is only displayed on the homepage by being somehow required in index.php. Depending on what language has been selected it should show either picture 1 or 2. Currently only the first picture is displayed because I have no way of knowing which one should be used. Normally there is a $language_id variable which I can check if it is either 1 (english) or 2 (german). Unfortunately $language_id in inside.php is empty (or at least it looks like it) so I need a way to access the variable from index.php. Is there a way to do this without passing this variable or something like that? (Since it is a osCommerce-shop I am not sure how I could to that)</p> <p>I hope what I tried to explain is somewhat understandable, if not, please ask and I'll try to clarify.</p>

I'll be calling these methods in different view controllers to the one which manages logging in, so I need a way to store the auth_key which is returned upon login.</p> <p>Should I use a global variable?

22753351	0	Comparisons with "Comparable" type variables in java? <p>I'm working on a University assignment, and I have to store elements in an array of the "Comparable" type. Eg: </p> <pre><code>protected Comparable storage[]; </code></pre> <p>The elements that will be stored in this array are going to be either all integers, or all strings, but they're obviously created with the "Comparable" type as opposed to being created as int, or String. </p> <p>What I'm having problems doing is comparing these values. At any given point, say the array is filled with "Comparable" elements that are actually integers, how can I compare them? I get that I have to use the compareTo() method, but what would the implementation look like? I've looked at the Java document online, and it has simply confused me even more. </p> <p>Just to summarize, at any given point, the array might have "Comparable" type elements that are actually all integers, or all the elements will be Strings that were also made with the "Comparable" type. There's no mixing and matching of the integer and Strings in the array, it's just one or the other. I want to know how I would make the compareTo() method so that I can easily compare two elements in the array, or any two "Comparable" elements for that matter, and return say a 1, -1, or 0 if one is greater/less than the other</p> <p>Would appreciate any help. I'm completely lost.</p>
10821762	0	Using GDB for debugging netlink communication <p>I have a multi-threaded application that communicates with a kernel module using netlink sockets. One of the threads in user mode application works as a server and kernel module works as a client. Roughly the kernel code is as follows: </p> <pre><code>timeout = 3500; netlink_unicast(); wait: __set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE); timeout = schedule_timeout(timeout); __set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING); if (!timeout) { printk(KERN_ERR "No response received\n"); return -1; } if (message_status != UPDATED) { printk(KERN_ERR "Somebody woke us up before we got a reply. Time left %d\n", timeout); __set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE); goto wait; } </code></pre> <p>The <strong>message_status</strong> variable is updated in the netlink callback when the user mode application replies to this message. So basically the idea is to send a message and then wait at max timeout jiffies for the reply.</p> <p>Now, using gdb, if I add a break point in any function that is called by netlink server thread in user mode, the break point is never hit and the kernel log is flooded with messages like </p> <blockquote> <p>Somebody woke us up before we got a reply. Time left 3499</p> <p>Somebody woke us up before we got a reply. Time left 3499</p> <p>Somebody woke us up before we got a reply. Time left 3499</p> <p>Somebody woke us up before we got a reply. Time left 3499</p> <p>..</p> <p>..</p> <p>Somebody woke us up before we got a reply. Time left 3498</p> </blockquote> <p>Until I finally get </p> <blockquote> <p>No response received</p> </blockquote> <p>What is causing the kernel thread to wake up from the timeout and how should I debug the user mode code?</p> <p>PS: I am using 2.6.32-71.el6.x86_64 on RHEL 6.0</p>

28834992	0	setOnClickFillInIntent Error Handling <p>I have made an appWidget with a collection view. And in order to handle a click event on each view of the collection view, I used 'setPendingIntentTemplate' and 'setOnClickFillInIntent'. It is working fine in a normal case. It opens up the target activity by sending the intent upon click. But if an invalid uri (it is just not a valid uri for the target activity, but in syntax, it is a valid uri.) is injected to the intent for it, the widget just simply doesn't handle the click event. It doesn't throw any exception or return any error.</p> <pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(link); intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK); view.setOnClickFillInIntent(R.id.image, intent); </code></pre> <p>Is there any way to catch this error (the click event is not being handled due to the intent with an invalid uri)? - So that, I can switch to different code to handle the situation.</p>

31329158	1	Manipulating validated data in Colander SchemaNode <p>I have a set of Colander SchemaNodes used with Pyramid/Cornice in an API. For some querystring args, a range is passed (ie <code>time=X-Y</code> means a time range from X to Y where X and Y are integers representing epochs). I currently validate this with a <code>RegEx()</code> validator to ensure an epoch or epoch range is passed in:</p> <pre><code>class TimeOrRange(SchemaNode): schema_type = String location = "querystring" description = 'Time (or range) in epochs: ssssssssss(-ssssssssss)' validator = Regex("^[0-9]{10}\-{0,1}[0-9]{0,10}$") </code></pre> <p>I then use this in a MappingSchema which is then tied to my Cornice view with <code>@view(schema=TimedThingGet)</code>:</p> <pre><code>class TimedThingGet(MappingSchema): time = TimeOrRange(missing=drop) </code></pre> <p>What I would like to do is update the return value in my <code>TimeOrRange</code> SchemaNode code so <code>time</code> in <code>TimedThingGet</code> is a tuple of time ranges. In other words, if <code>time=X-Y</code> is passed in to a <code>TimedThingGet</code> instance, then <code>time=(x, y)</code> is returned in the validated data. Similarly, if only <code>X</code> is passed in, then I want <code>Y</code> to be set to the epoch of <code>now()</code>. </p> <p>It looks like <code>set_value()</code> is the way to go, and here's where the problem get's some extra credit: </p> <ol> <li>Does <code>set_value</code> get called before or after validation?</li> <li>Does <code>set_value</code> have access to the validator such that a <code>RegEx</code> validator which creates regex groups could then be used to set my tuple: <code>time=(validated.match.group[1], validated.match.group[2])</code>?</li> </ol>

23793046	0	Pixelate images when hovering over parent div using javascript <p>Searching around for ways to do this, I found a couple good explanations out there, and ended up combining them. I had everything working fine when I was just doing the hover effect when mousing over the image itself, but when trying to make it work when hovering over the "profile" div seems to have caused some problems. Currently, it will sometimes also be pixelated when not over the div, so it remains somewhere between the mouseover and mouseout states.</p> <h2>HTML</h2> <p>In the HTML, I'm creating a filterable directory of people using isotope that contains a bunch of blocks like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;div class="item profile p-1 undergrad research"&gt; &lt;div class="profile-image"&gt; &lt;img src="img.jpg"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="profile-text"&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Name&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Position&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt; Email:email@gmail.com&lt;br&gt; Phone: 123.345.6567&lt;br&gt; Office: 2818 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre> <h2>Javascript</h2> <p>I'm using javascript to handle the pixelation stuff right now, but to be honest I'm a lot more familiar and comfortable with Jquery, so this has been a struggle and learning experience. Below is the whole code, but I'll explain what I changed that started my issues.</p> <p>Originally, "items" in setup was taking <em>.profile-image</em> objects, and I changed that to <em>.profile</em> objects so I could use the ".profile" div as the object with the mouseover event listener. At this point I introduced <em>"block"</em>, which i switched the event listeners to from <em>"element"</em>. </p> <pre><code>// Most of the structure taken from Noel Delgado // @pixelia_me =&gt; http://codepen.io/noeldelgado/pen/FmEBh // The actual pixelation taken from Ken Fyrstenberg Nilsen // http://jsfiddle.net/AbdiasSoftware/QznT7/ // http://www.paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/ /* ** ======================================================================= ** Animation ** ======================================================================= */ var lastTime = 0; var vendors = ['webkit', 'moz']; for(var x = 0; x &lt; vendors.length &amp;&amp; !window.requestAnimationFrame; ++x) { window.requestAnimationFrame = window[vendors[x]+'RequestAnimationFrame']; window.cancelAnimationFrame = window[vendors[x]+'CancelAnimationFrame'] || window[vendors[x]+'CancelRequestAnimationFrame']; } if (!window.requestAnimationFrame) window.requestAnimationFrame = function(callback, element) { var currTime = new Date().getTime(); var timeToCall = Math.max(0, 16 - (currTime - lastTime)); var id = window.setTimeout(function(){callback(currTime + timeToCall);}, timeToCall); lastTime = currTime + timeToCall; return id; }; if (!window.cancelAnimationFrame) window.cancelAnimationFrame = function(id) { clearTimeout(id); }; /* ** ======================================================================= ** Pixelation ** ======================================================================= */ /*============================="Setup"===============================*/ var PIXELATION = 36,//The value when hovering.

14252678	0	Backbone.js per attribute rendering (multiple small views vs multiple templates per view ) <p>I have a model and a view. The view displays attributes of a model and allows the user to manipulate these attributes. The problem is that when an attribute is modified it re-renders the whole view which causes a lot of problems for me.</p> <p><em>Example blur event on a text input saves the new input to an attribute and thus fires render. Which means that if the user clicked from that text input straight to a button on the same view that event will never fire as the first event that fires will be blur causing the whole view to re-render and thus losing the button click event.</em></p> <p>I have two ideas:</p> <ol> <li>Have a single view where every attribute is in a separate template. Then I bind to a particular attribute change event and in render I update only the html of the changed attribute. This seems like a hack, as there is a lot of work to force the view to update only the changed attribute. It will add a lot of unnecessary complexity to an already complex view.</li> <li>Create a master view which consists of views, where each of them represents a model's attribute. This will create a lot of views, with nearly no functionality. </li> </ol> <p>I seem to prefer the 2. option. What do you think? What are the best practices? Is there any better way to handle this?</p>

1487275	0	Programmatically switch the ID generator in NH mapping file <p>So I'm currently attempting to do a promotion of objects from one database to another in my app. Basically I want to allow the user to click a button and promote changes from staging to production, as it were.</p> <p>To do this, I really want to keep the IDs the same in order to help with debugging. So for example if the object has an ID of 6 in the staging db, I want it to have that same ID on production. To do this, we turned off identity on our production db and just made those primary key columns with non-null integers.</p> <p>In my staging mapping file, my IDs are mapped using the "identity" generator, but for production I want them to be "assigned". Is it possible to programmatically change this, perhaps using an interceptor or something similar?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p>

Default.cshtml page regulates all the requests for all domains including DB connection, _Layout, etc etc...? To put it simple: the domain paris.com has only two tags: PlaceID And includeFile/General Domain/Default.aspx Default.aspx sees PlaceID and acts accordingly.
